Lee) writes: In article <tenneyC62HqH.6s1@netcom.com Glenn S. Tenney, tenney@netcom.com writes:  of interest.  I understand that on 29 April, Mr. Markey will be holding a  hearing on the questions raised in this letter.  There may also be a follow-on  hearing dedicated to the clipper chip, but that's not definite.  Glenn,  Thanks for posting that.  I was surprised to notice, however, that one question I might have expected to be asked was not:  ""Are all forms of strong encryption other than the Clipper to be made illegal?""  Speaking of which, is anyone aware of whether that question *has* been asked of any knowledgeable or official spokesperson for the government?  I have not yet seen it mentioned in any of a dozen places it might have been reported, but I could have easily missed it.  Please let us know if you get a solid answer to the question of legality of other strong cryptosystems.   So far any references I have seen have been weasel-words (""more plans in the future, etc""), but nothing that could be taken as a ""NO (strong crypto will NOT be outlawed)"".  I have heard (not verified) that the Crime Bill before Congress has language that either requires escrow of keys, or that will regard all systems 'unapproved' for public use, like strong cryptosystems not trivially broken by the Govt, or without escrowed keys which one cannot readily change (read: use being only permitted by folks with 'special' connections, or government agencies) as either 'terrorist tools' or 'drug dealers tools'.  Not outlawed SPECIFICALLY but by added Civil Forfeiture powers, and clever wording, EFFECTIVELY outlawed for all intents and purposes.  Now, for some idle speculation ... for those who don't care, hit 'n' now.  Crypto being EFFECTIVELY outlawed could be done without SPECIFICALLY outlawing ANY class of crypto systems.  For example, a crowbar, hammers, screwdrivers, and such can be regarded as 'burglar tools' pretty much at the whim of the authorities, based primarily on the individual possessing them in the car, etc. not being in a trade that makes routine use of these tools.  In a like manner, one who has no 'legitimate need' (gov't definition) for strong crypto software or systems, and is caught using them, might find themselves in possession of 'terrorist tools'. In other words, if one is not working for a corporation with extremely sensitive commercial data that warrants (in the Fed's opinion) strong security, or a government agency, and securing only work-related data, not personal data, one will most likely be nailed on this if discoverd. A personal desire for 'privacy' most certainly will not be regarded as a 'legitimate NEED':  ""Why do you want such strong security, especially from 'legitimate law enforcement'? An individual with 'legitimate' endeavors would not be so concerned - government is not in the business of revealing your personal secrets to the public... so you must be trying to conceal or planning to conceal some unlawful or criminal activity...  DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO HIDE, HMMMM?"" I expect that initially there will be some people selected either at random, or who happen to have been 'troublemakers' for the purposes of 'making an example' for those who think the Feds are not SERIOUS about this... (mega ':-('s)  One asking about a 'right' to privacy will probably get a response that there is no constitutional right for privacy spelled out AS SUCH (an argument used in the abortion debate):  ""You do NOT have a right to have security that 'Legitimate Law Enforcement cannot break'"" (as suggested in the Clipper Press Release).  This, in a nutshell, is what I find so extremely frightening.  Not only for crypto systems, as in this case, but for the precident it will set, laying the groundwork for future erosions of privacy (escrow of both safe-deposit box keys - 'master' keys or combinations for privately owned safes, and so on.  WHY NOT?)...  I cannot think of a better way to make an 'end-run' around those 'inconvenient' parts of the US Constitution.  A law cannot be easily declared unconstitutional, if it there IS NO SPECIFIC LAW.  It would simply be a minor extension of the RICO statutes or WoD policies. A simple policy decision, just like so many of the gun regulations are mainly BATF policy decisions...  The Conversation of the Fed agents would go something like:  ""We are gonna seize your home, your computers, your car, your bank account, (you don't have to undress and give us yer clothes, unless you have a floppy in yer pocket) because they are all connected with your acquisition, transport, and use of 'terrorist tools' and/or 'drug dealers tools' - part of the WoD or against terrorism, ya unnerstand... no decent American Subject would be against these noble causes..."".  ""Note we are not accusing YOU of any wrong-doing ... we are only saying your HOME, COMPUTERS, CAR, BANK ASSETS are connected with wrong-doing SOMEHOW - they housed, transported, and funded these 'terrorist tools'. Only a civil matter ...  <heh-heh ... We had this 'tip'...<grin"".  ""Therefore, the Constitutional Protection on Individual rights do NOT apply - we are 'arresting' the tainted PROPERTY... not YOU...<evil grin"".  ""If you wish to deposit a BOND, hire some attorneys, and go to court to PROVE the innocence of this property (that they are not 'terrorist tools' and again to prove they are not also 'drug dealers tools'), go ahead, we have no problem with that!  'Course, with your bank assets seized, no car, computer, or home, (probably no job, too) and your less-than-limitless resources, you might run into some minor practical difficulties <grin..."".  THAT is what has me going so damned ballistic...  It is EXACTLY how the logic goes when someone gives a 'tip' that your home has been used to store DRUGS...  Note no trace of drugs need to be found on the property... only some bozo who will say 'yup.  I stored stuff in that dude's house...' (probably to get out of a 10 year sentence for dealing).  Much more cost effective to let him walk, to bust another day, and hit the jackpot with YOUR assets...  Ob Disclaimer (of course)...  Ok, note that I am not a lawyer, and can only base these speculations on what I have read/heard/been told regarding past Civil Forfeiture cases, and how they are used to augment the budgets of assorted agencies, or to get 'cooperation' of folks who just want to be left alone, or who do not wish to be put in a risky situation (especially in areas where they are denied either meaningful police protection, AND the means to be able to even pretend to defend themselves, as is quite common back East, like NJ, MA, NYC, Wa DC, or out West in CA).  These people have the choice of cowering under the government boot, or cowering under threats of pissed off drug dealing gang-bangers... helpless in either case... All behind some dude who drops a dime on you for his gain, or behind the Feds wanting to 'make an example'...  Civil Forfeiture being the 'hook'.  Point is, are these speculations way out of line, or are they all too typical, and if so, does the extension to crypto and just about anything that the Feds regard as 'inconvenient' seem reasonable?

I create a bunch of sets of random data, and encrypt it.  I  keep only one of the sets of random data around, to show that I encypt random data for kicks.  The rest, I delete with their keys.  I tell all my friends. I think this establishes reasonable doubt about the contents of any encrypted files, and my ability to provides keys.  Since anyone could do this, any law that forces a user to provide keys on demand is worthless.  The law is much worse than worthless.  It gives police the power to put innocent people in jail because they (the police) find something they don't understand.  Most police don't know what the return key does, never mind the difference between a core file and classified military secrets.  There are plenty of scenarios where the user would have no idea what something is either.  It could be uninitialized junk.  The burden of proof is on the user to show that it's something a normal upstanding citizen should have.  No one should ever be put in that situation, especially in America.  What's disgusting about this is how easily most people go along with it, to provide a bargaining chip against some hypothetical *alleged* child molester or drug dealer, or whatever bad thing is in style at the time.  Basically most people don't have a clear distinction between criminals and suspects.  As an analogy, it's like they find a loose screw in your house, and they insist that you're building a bomb or machine gun.  They ask you where it came from (like you'd know), and ask you to prove your claim.  When you explain it in such simple terms, people may start to get the idea.  As a matter of fact, i do keep random files on my disk.  The reason is, without special-purpose hardware, it takes a long time to generate good random bits.  I have programs that crank out a couple bits per minute, which is pretty conservative, but over time that's more than i need.  If you think about it, there's no point in actually encrypting random data, because it just gives you different random data.  If you want some data to look like an encrypted file, you just put an appropriate header on it.  If enough people do this, some of them will be put in jail.  When you get arrested and the police ask for your keys, you can tell them it's just random junk, although of course they won't believe you.  While you're sitting in jail, you can take consolation in the fact that the government will burn a few CPU-years trying to find something that's not there.  -- Joe Keane, amateur cryptologist jgk@osc.com (uunet!amdcad!osc!jgk)

Why doing it in such a rough manner? It is much more professional to steal the chip from the phone and even to replace it with a pin-compatible do-nothing chip that does not encrypt at all. Chances are that the victim will not notice anything, especially if it is done professionally.   Once a suitable collection of devices is stolen, criminals can communicate  with impunity (assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from  key escrow) until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means.  No, because the Feds will still be able to decrypt the conversations. True, they'll blame the wrong guys, but nevertheless one cannot say something like ""The drugs arrive tommorrow on the ship 'Terminus'"" when the Feds are listening, even if they cannot identify who the speaker is.  No, the criminals will just use some secure encryption.

Remember, I don't even think of Clipper as encryption in any real  sense--if I did, I'd probably be a lot more annoyed about it.  I agree with this assessment.  Furthermore, its promotion as providing greater protection than bare voice is quite true, as far as it goes.  However, the only way for it to fulfill its stated goal of letting LE wiretap ""terrorists and drug dealers"" is to restrict stronger techniques.    Wiretap targets presently use strong encryption, weak encryption, or (the vast majority) no encryption.  The latter two classes can be tapped.  With weak encryption in every phone, the no-encryption class is merged into the weak-encryption class.  Will the introduction of Clipper cause targets presently enjoying strong privacy to give up on it?  that is, to rely for privacy on a system expressly designed to deny it to people like them?  I doubt it.  The mere introduction of this scheme will give the government *nothing*.  The stated goal of preventing the degradation of wiretapping capabilities can be fulfilled by restriction of domestic cryptography, and only by this restriction.  ""Clipper"" appears to be no more than a sop, given to the public to mute any complaints.  We would find this a grossly inadequate tradeoff, but I fear the public at large will not care.  I hate to even mention gun control, but most people seem to think that an `assault weapon' (as the NYT uses the word) is some sort of automatic weapon, .50 caliber maybe.  Who wants to have such a thing legal?  Well, people know even less about cryptology  I suspect that strong cryptography could easily be labeled ""too much secrecy for law-abiding citizens to need"".  That's not for Clinton (or anyone under him) to say, though.  Only the  federal and supreme courts can say anything about the constitutionality. Anything the administration or any governmental agency says is opinion at  best.  What they say is opinion, but what they do is what matters, and will continue unless overturned.  And the courts are reluctant to annul law or regulation, going to some length to decide cases on other grounds.  Furthermore, Congress can get away with quite a bit.  They could levy a burdensome tax  this would place enforcement in the hands of the BATF, who as we've seen you really don't want on your case.  They could invoke the Commerce Clause  this seems most likely.  This clause will get you anywhere these days.  The 18th was required because the Supreme Court ruled a prohibitory statute unconstitutional.  In 1970 Congress prohibited many drugs, with a textual nod to the Commerce Clause.

sci_crypt;"From: grady@netcom.com (1016/2EF221) Subject: powerful ""similarity"" too  A Unix tool of cryptographic significance is available for anonymous ftp.  ""agrep 2.0.4"" -- a fast approximate pattern-matching tool  source code project available from:  cs.arizona.edu   in directory ""agrep""  agrep is a very fast fuzzy search tool with a tremendous number of powerful search options.  The one most obviously applicable to cryptography (key selection) is to be able to specify the ""similarity"" of matches in the data.  For example say you make up a password/phrase of ""qimwe7l"". Of course you rightly suspect that this key itself is not in any dictionary or word list.  But how *close* is it to en entry that could be varied by some ""crack"" program to brute-force search for it?  You use agrep to find out.  Looking with argument for none, one or two errors, no matches.  Good so far.  But   agrep -3 ""qimwe7l"" bigwordandphraselist  finds that the pattern ""qimwe7l"" is too close to the pattern ""imsel"" (part of ""himself"" and a host of others), to be of any cryptographic value as a key.  An error of level two corresponds to a simple transposition of letters like ""teh"" for ""the"".  A minimally acceptable password would have to pass as *least* level 3 in order not immediately ruled-out as even a remote possibility of being a good password. (In real cryptographic use, my personal passphrases clear at *least* level 8 on my rather large [80 meg] word and phrase lists.)   And for searching for key words in human-typed data (lots o' typos) the tool is unexcelled.  For example, For example, say I want to find out what people think about Gibson's SF book ""Neuromancer"" in the huge SF-Lover's archives. Even with an error distance specification as small as of ""1"" I will find all those people who think the title was ""Necromancer"" or other common typos.  Why miss anything?  Also, the program can look for up to 30,000 patterns IN PARALLEL at Boyer-Moore (sublinear) speeds.  Great for a NSA wannabe to look for your name, terrorists names, special Tagalog or religious words, etc. in the news or e-mail spool directories.  You can even search for ciphertext by using, say, 30,000 random three-byte combinations and eliminate all texts that don't score the X chi-square 'birthday' hits on message size Y.  You think some crypto-terrorist is try to foil you by changing the pattern on you?  No problem.  Try agrep -p NSA to find NSA, National Security Agency, NSecAg, No Such Agency, National Scrabble Association, N*S*A, etc.  You can also specify ""fixed"" areas: looking for license plate XYZ123 when you know that the letters are correct, you might say:  agrep -2 <XYZ123 licenseplatedatabase  will find all plates starting with XYZ with up to two errors (addition, substitution, deletion) in the number area.  You can also ""weight"" the relative ""cost"" for substiutions, additions, or deletion errors.  For example, when searching DNA patterns for a particular protein combination, you might know that some kinds of damage cause the ""A"" nucelotide to drop out more than other errors... you could adjust for this bias by setting -Dc where you set the ""deletion cost"" to count as ""c"" errors.  A steganographic use (I even used ""agrep -2 ""<stegeograp"" E"" just now to find the correct spelling!) would be to intentionally introduce errors of a certain type and magnitude into a plaintext and then later recover the orginal it via an agrep pipe.  Lots of possibilities here when only outlaws can have ciphertext...  Also with agrep's powerful extraction options it makes it easy to abstract the ""hits"" into a useful form.  For example,  agrep -d ""From"" 'PGP (passphrase|Zimmerman|NSA)'  says output the entire mail record, delimited by 'From' that contains 'PGP' and contains either 'passphrase', 'Zimmerman', or 'NSA'.  And agrep has been measured an order-of-magnitude faster than the second-best similarity tool publicly available.  As usual, I will be glad to e-mail the source and docs to those who reqest them by e-mail IF they cannot do an anonymous FTP.  Get this now. It is too powerful to stay in the hands of the NSA.

What happens when someone plugs the above ciphertext into a receiving chip? To get M the receiving chip needs K_P  to get K_P the receiving chip needs U_C. The only information it can work with is C.

What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  In these two sections the phrases `or other legal order' and `normally a court order' imply there is some other way or ways of doing a legal wiretap. What is/are these? How do they affect the way people who trust the system of court orders to protect them feel about this escrow system?  The second section shows the sequence of events. The law enforcer, armed with his warrant, attaches his headphones to the line with his croc-clips (remember, these are the folk who couldn't cope with digital telephony) and hears a load of modem-like tones (we are talking analogue telephony here). What next? What modulation scheme do these Clipper boxes use? Is it possible to record the tones for use after the keys are obtained? I thought it was quite difficult to record a modem session at some intermediate point on the line. Maybe they have taken a crash course in data comms and have a unit that demodulates the tones and stores the digital stream for decryption later. This would still suffer from the same problems as trying to record the tones as the demodulator would not be at one end of the line. If calls can't be recorded for decryption later it would be quite easy to foil the system by buying lots of Clipper units (these are supposed to be cheap mass market items) and using them in turn.  How tolerant is the modulation scheme to errors? These things are proposed for use by US corporations to secure their foreign offices, where phone line quality may well be poor. It seems hard enough to me to get digitised speech of any quality into something a modem can handle without having to add lots of error correction to keep the decryption in sync.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?  A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control      requirements.  ...  One of the      attractions of this technology is the protection it can give      to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this      in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a      case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these      devices to secure their own communications abroad.      ...  This raises an intersting question in the UK. Here it is illegal to connect anything to a public telecomms network without it being approved by a body called BABT. It has been stated, either here or in the uk.telecom group, that they will not approve equipment that does encryption. I don't know if this is true or not, but this would make a good test case. Perhaps `friendly' countries, and the UK may still qualify, will get to fish in the escrowed key pool as well.   		Peter Ilieve		peter@memex.co.uk

Internet drafts on Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) describe a standard   under revision for six years delineating the official protocols for   email encryption.  The standard has only recently stabilized and   implementations are being developed.    - RFC-1421: ``Privacy Enhancement for Internet Electronic Mail:      Part I: Message Encryption and Authentication Procedures.'' J.     Linn <104-8456@mcimail.com    - RFC-1422: ``Privacy Enhancement for Internet Electronic Mail: Part     II: Certificate-Based Key Management'' S.

Balenson     <belenson@tis.com    Send email to pem-info@tis.com for more information.  See ``RFCs    related to privacy'' for information on how to obtain RFCs.    _____ <4.6 What are other Requests For Comments (RFCs) related to privacy?    RFC-822:  SMTP, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol   RFC-977:  NNTP, Network News Transfer Protocol   RFC-1036: Standard for interchange of network news messages   RFC-1208: Glossary of Networking Terms   RFC-1207: Answers to ``experienced Internet user'' questions   RFC-1206: Answers to ``new Internet user'' questions   RFC-1355: Privacy issues in Network Information center databases       RFC-1177 is ``FYI: Answers to commonly asked ``new internet user''    questions, and includes: basic terminology on the Internet (TCP/IP,   SMTP, FTP), internet  organizations such as IAB (Internet   Activities Board) and IETF  (Internet Enbgineering Task Force), and   a glossary of terms.  Also from ftp.eff.org:   /pub/internet-info/internet.q.     RFCs can be obtained via FTP from NIC.DDN.MIL, with the pathname    RFC:RFCnnnn.TXT or RFC:RFCnnnn.PS (where `nnnn' refers to the    number of the RFC).  Login with FTP, username `anonymous' and    password `guest'.  The NIC also provides an automatic mail    service for those sites which cannot use FTP.  Address the    request to SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL and in the subject field of the    message indicate the RFC number, as in `Subject: RFC nnnn' (or    `Subject: RFC nnnn.PS' for PostScript RFCs).       RFCs can also be obtained via FTP from NIS.NSF.NET.  Using FTP,    login with username `anonymous' and password `guest'  then    connect to the RFC directory (`cd RFC').  The file name is of the    form RFCnnnn.TXT-1 (where `nnnn' refers to the number of the    RFC).  The NIS also provides an automatic mail service for those    sites which cannot use FTP.  Address the request to    NIS-INFO@NIS.NSF.NET and leave the subject field of the message    blank.  The first line of the text of the message must be `SEND    RFCnnnn.TXT-1', where nnnn is replaced by the RFC number.    _____ <4.7 How can I run an anonymous remailer?    Cypherpunk remailer source is at soda.berkeley.edu in the   /pub/cypherpunks directory.  It's written in PERL, and is   relatively easy to install (no administrative rights are required).   Karl Barrus  <elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu has more information and   modifications. Also, most remailer operators mentioned above are   amenable to discussing features, problems, and helping new sites   become operational. Address all points in the section   ``responsibities of anonymous use'' in this document prior to   advertising your service.  You should be committed to the long-term   stability of the site and avoid running one surreptitiously.  _____ <4.8 What are references on privacy in email?

CROSSLINK is an anonymous message system run on MIT Student    Cable TV-36. It provides an anonymous medium through which MIT    students can say those things they might otherwise find    difficult, inconvenient or impossible to say in person.  It's    also a way to send fun or totally random messages to your    friends over the air.  It is similar to the anonymous message    pages found in many college newspapers, except that it's    electronic in nature and it's free.    Messages can be posted to the service via email.  For more   information send email to crosslink@athena.mit.edu.   MISCELLANEOUS =============  _____ <5.1 What is ``digital cash''?    With digital encryption and authentication technologies, the   possibility of a widespread digital cash system may someday be   realized.  A system utilizing codes sent between users and banks   (similar to today's checking system except entirely digital) may   be one approach.  The issues of cryptography, privacy, and   anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an   economy.  See the article in Scientific American by David Chaum   (~Dec.1992).    An experimental digital bank is run by Karl Barrus   <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU based on suggestions by Hal Finney on the   cypherpunks mailing list.  To use the server send mail to   elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu message with the following text:      ::     command: help          user@host    where `user@host' is your email address.      _____ <5.2 What is a ``hacker'' or ``cracker''?    These terms arouse strong feelings by many on their meaning,   especially on the internet.  In the general news media in the past   a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends (such as   breaking into systems) has been referred to as a hacker, but most   internet users prefer the term ``cracker'' for this.  Instead, a   ``hacker'' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious,   curious, and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a   system, for example---something of a proud electronic pioneer and   patriot.  This is the sense intended in this document.  See also   the ``Hacker's Dictionary'' and the FAQ `alt-security-faq'.     _____ <5.3 What is a ``cypherpunk''?    From the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list:     Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were    more of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy    must create it for themselves and not expect governments,    corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant    them privacy out of beneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people    have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers,    envelopes, closed doors, and couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek    to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or    their opinions.    See information on the cypherpunk mailing list below.    See also the CryptoAnarchist Manifesto and the Cryptography Glossary   in soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks.  _____ <5.4 What is `steganography' and anonymous pools?    Closely associated with encryption is `steganography' or the   techniques for not only pursuing private (encrypted) communication   but concealing the very  existence of the communication itself.    Many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the   proliferation of computer technology.  For example, it is possible   to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images,   typically the most 'noisy'. In addition, when such an item is   posted in a public place (such as a newsgroup), virtually   untraceable  communication can take place between sender and   receiver.  For  steganographic communications in the electronic   realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where   individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual   users decode particular messages with their unique key.   An   anonymous pool has been set up by Miron Cuperman   (miron@extropia.wimsey.com) for experiments.  Send email to   <pool0-request@extropia.wimsey.com  with one of the following   commands in the subject line:      subscribe     unsubscribe     help  _____ <5.5 What is `security through obscurity'?    `Security through obscurity' refers to the attempt to gain   protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information   or programs relating to them.  For example, a company may not make   public information on its software's encryption techniques to evade   `attacks' based on knowledge of it. Another example would be   concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in   operating systems.  Or, some reliance may be made on the fact that   some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious   because they are ``not widely known'' or ``not widely used.'' This   argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and Usenet   posting `forgery'. `Security through obscurity' is regarded as a   very feeble  technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at   worst (also called the ``head-in-the-sand approach''). See the FAQ   for alt.security.        Some remarks of John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the Electronic   Frontier Foundation, directed to NSA agents at the First   International Symposium on National Security & National   Competitiveness held in McLean, Virginia  Dec. 1, 1992:     Digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep    contained. ... This stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile.  It's    almost a life form in its ability to self-propagate.  If    something hits the Net and it's something which people on there    find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind.  I    believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into    an environment where any information which is at all interesting    to people is going to get out.  And there will be very little    that you can do about it.  This is not a bad thing in my view,    but you may differ...  _____ <5.6 What are `identity daemons'?      RFC-931 describes a protocol standard that allows UNIX programs to   query a remote user's login name after connection to a local   communication socket (a connection of this type is established   during FTP and TELNET sessions, for example).  The standard is not   widely supported, perhaps 10% of internet sites currently implement   it but the number is increasing.  The mechanism is detrimental to   anonymity.  Regular users cannot disable it but system   adminstrators can circumvent it.  This standard may represent a   trend toward greater authentication mechanisms.  _____ <5.7 What new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy?     Remailing/Posting   -----------------      - Stable, secure, protected, officially sanctioned and permitted,     publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs.   - Official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and USENET     postings.   - Truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information     obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms (chaining,     encrypted addresses, etc.)   - Standards for anonymous email addressing, embedding files, and     remailer site chaining.      General   -------      - Recognition of anonymity, cryptography, and related privacy     shields as legitimate, useful, desirable, and crucial by the     general public and their governments.   - Widespread use and implementation of these technologies      by systems designers into     hardware, software, and standards, implemented `securely,'     `seamlessly,' and `transparently'.   - General shift of use, dependence, and reliance to means other than     wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law enforcement     agencies.   - Publicity, retraction, and dissolution of laws and government     agencies opposed to privacy, replaced by structures dedicated to     strengthening and protecting it.   ISSUES ======  _____ <6.1 What is the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)?    From ftp.eff.org:/pub/EFF/mission_statement:     A new world is arising in the vast web of digital, electronic    media which connect us.  Computer-based communication media like    electronic mail and computer conferencing are becoming the basis    of new forms of community.  These communities without a single,    fixed geographical location comprise the first settlements on an    electronic frontier.        While well-established legal principles and cultural norms give    structure and coherence to uses of conventional media like    newspapers, books, and telephones, the new digital media do not    so easily fit into existing frameworks.  Conflicts come about as    the law struggles to define its application in a context where    fundamental notions of speech, property, and place take    profoundly new forms. People sense both the promise and the    threat inherent in new computer and communications technologies,    even as they struggle to master or simply cope with them in the    workplace and the home.        The Electronic Frontier Foundation has been established to help    civilize the electronic frontier  to make it truly useful and    beneficial not just to a technical elite, but to everyone  and to    do this in a way which is in keeping with our society's highest    traditions of the free and open flow of information and    communication.      EFF was started by the multimillionaire Mitchell Kapor, founder of   Lotus software, and John Barlow, lyricist for the Grateful Dead   rock band.  A highly publicized endeavor of the organization   involved the legal defense of  Steve Jackson Games after an FBI   raid and an accompanying civil suit  (see section on ``Steve   Jackson Games'').  The foundation publishes EFF News (EFFector   Online) electronically, send requests to effnews-request@eff.org.      In a letter to Mitchell Kapor from the Chairman of the Subcommittee   with primary jurisdiction over telecommunications policy dated   November 5, 1991,  Representative  Edward J. Markey complemented   Mitchell Kapor on his ``insights on the development of a national   public information infrastructure'' which ``were appreciated greatly   by myself and the Members of the Subcommittee'' (complete text in    ftp.eff.com:/pub/pub-infra/1991-12):     ...we need to pursue policies that encourage the Bell companies to    work with other sectors of the communications industry to create    a consumer-oriented, public information network. Please let me or    my staff know what policies you and others in the computer    industry believe would best serve the public interest in creating    a reasonably priced, widely available network in which    competition is open and innovation rewarded.  I also want to    learn what lessons from the computer industry over the past ten    to fifteen years should apply to the current debate on    structuring the information and communications networks of the    future....I ask your help in gaining input from the computer    industry so that the Subcommittee can shape policies that will    bring this spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship to the    information services industry.      ftp.eff.org   ===========      /pub/eff/about-eff   ---     A file of basic information about EFF including goals, mission,     achievements, and current projects.

The Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility have been   working to protect and promote electronic civil liberties issues   since ~1982.  The group has three offices (Palo Alto, Cambridge,   Washington, DC) and 20 chapters. It is involved in  litigation   against the FBI, The NSA, NIST, the Secret Service and other other   U.S. government agencies  to declassify and provide documentation   on issues such as Operation Sundevil, the FBI wiretap proposal,   NSA's interference in crypography, the breakup of the 2600 raid in   Arlington, Va in Nov 1992. Members speak frequently in front on   Congress, state legislators and public utility commissions to   testify on privacy, information policy, computer security, and   caller identification.    CPSR has created an extensive Internet Privacy library available   via FTP, Gopher, WAIS, and email at cpsr.org, currently comprising   the largest collection of privacy documents on the internet.  For   more information, anonymous FTP  cpsr.org:/cpsr/.     (Thanks to Dave Banisar <banisar@washofc.cpsr.org for contributions   here.)  _____ <6.3 What was `Operation Sundevil' and the Steve Jackson Game case?    In the early 1990's a fear spread among U.S. law enforcement agencies   on the illicit activities of `hackers' and `phreakers' involved in   such activities as credit card fraud and long-distance call thievery.      (see ftp.eff.org:/pub/SJG/General_Information/EFFector1.04):     `Operation Sundevil,' the Phoenix-inspired crackdown of May    8,1990, concentrated on telephone code-fraud and credit-card    abuse, and followed this seizure plan with some success.     [Bulletin Board Systems] went down all over America, terrifying    the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of    their criminal instruments.  It also saddled analysts with some    24,000 floppy disks, and confronted harried Justice Department    prosecutors with the daunting challenge of a gigantic nationwide    hacker show-trial involving highly technical issues in dozens of    jurisdictions.    Massive `show-trials' never materialized, although isolated   instances of prosecution were pursued.  The movement reached a   crescendo in Texas with the highly publicized case of illegal   search and seizure involving the Steve Jackson Games company of   Austin Texas on March 1, 1990.  From the column GURPS' LABOUR LOST   by Bruce Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us in Fantasy and Science   Fiction Magazine:     In an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional    warrant, agents of the Secret Service conducted a search of the    SJG office.  When they left they took a manuscript being prepared    for publication, private electronic mail, and several computers,    including the hardware and software of the SJG Computer Bulletin    Board System.  Yet Jackson and his business were not only    innocent of any crime, but never suspects in the first place.     The raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that    somewhere in Jackson's office there `might be' a document    compromising the security of the 911 telephone system.    FBI agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed   on behalf of Steve Jackson Games by The Electronic Frontier   Foundation.  See information on EFF below.  From an article by Joe   Abernathy in the Houston Chronicle ~Feb 1, 1993:       AUSTIN -- An electronic civil rights case against the Secret    Service closed Thursday with a clear statement by federal    District Judge Sam Sparks that the Service failed to conduct a    proper investigation in a notorious computer crime crackdown,    and went too far in retaining  custody of seized equipment.         Secret Service Special Agent Timothy Foley of Chicago, who was in    charge of three Austin computer search-and-seizures on March 1,    1990, that led to the lawsuit, stoically endured Spark's rebuke    over the Service's poor investigation and abusive computer    seizure policies.  While the Service has seized dozens of    computers since the crackdown began in 1990, this is the first    case to challenge the practice.         Sparks grew visibly angry when it was established that the Austin    science fiction magazine and game book publisher was never    suspected of a crime, and that agents did not do even marginal    research to establish a criminal connection between the firm and    the suspected illegal activities of an employee, or to determine    that the company was a publisher. Indeed, agents testified that    they were not even trained in the Privacy Protection Act at the    special Secret Service school on computer crime.         ""How long would it have taken you, Mr. Foley, to find out what    Steve Jackson Games did, what it was?"" asked Sparks. ""An hour?         ""Was there any reason why, on March 2, you could not return to    Steve Jackson Games a copy, in floppy disk form, of everything    taken?         ""Did you read the article in Business Week magazine where it had    a picture of Steve Jackson -- a law-abiding, tax-paying citizen    -- saying he was a computer crime suspect?         ""Did it ever occur to you, Mr. Foley, that seizing this material    could harm Steve Jackson economically?""         Foley replied, ""No, sir,"" but the judge offered his own answer.         ""You actually did, you just had no idea anybody would actually go    out and hire a lawyer and sue you.""         More than $200,000 has been spent by the Electronic Frontier     Foundation in bringing the case to trial. The EFF was founded by     Mitchell Kapor amid a civil liberties movement sparked in large    part by the Secret Service computer crime crackdown.      ftp.eff.org   ===========      /pub/cud/papers/sundevil   ---     A collection of information on Operation SunDevil by the Epic     nonprofit publishing project. Everything you wanted to know but     could never find.    /pub/cud/papers/sj-resp   ---     Steve Jackson's response to the charges against him.  _____ <6.4 What is Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)?    ISDN is a high-speed data communications standard that utilizes   existing copper telephone lines, and is a possible inexpensive and   intermediate alternative to laying fiber optic cable for phone   networks.  The speeds involved may be sufficient for audio and   video transmission applications.  G. V. der Leun in the file   ftp.eff.org: /pub/pub-infra/1991-11:     Telecommunications in the United States is at a crossroads.  With    the Regional Bell Operating Companies now free to provide    content, the shape of the information networking is about to be    irrevocably altered.  But will that network be the open,    accessible, affordable network that the American public needs?     You can help decide this question.        The Electronic Frontier Foundation recently presented a plan to    Congress calling for the immediate deployment of a national    network based on existing ISDN technology, accessible to anyone    with a telephone connection, and priced like local voice service.     We believe deployment of such a platform will spur the    development of innovative new information services, and maximize    freedom, competitiveness, and civil liberties throughout the    nation.        The EFF is testifying before Congress and the FCC  making    presentations to public utility commisions from Massachusetts to    California  and meeting with representatives from telephone    companies, publishers, consumer advocates, and other stakeholders    in the telecommunications policy debate.        The EFF believes that participants on the Internet, as pioneers on    the electronic frontier, need to have their voices heard at this    critical moment.    To automatically receive a description of the platform and details,   send mail to archive-server@eff.org, with the following line:      send documents open-platform-overview    or send mail to eff@eff.org.

From `BBS Legislative Watch: FBIs Wiretapping Proposal Thwarted' by   S. Steele in Boardwatch Magazine, Feb. 1993, p. 19-22:      In a move that worried privacy experts, software manufacturers and    telephone companies, the FBI proposed legislation to amend the    Communications Act of 1934 to make it easier for the Bureau to    perform electronic wiretapping. The proposed legislation,    entitled 'Digital Telephony,' would have required communications    service providers and hardware manufacturers to make their    systems 'tappable' by providing 'back doors' through which law    enforcement officers could intercept communications. Furthermore,    this capability would have been provided undetectably, while the    communications was in progress, exclusive of any communications    between other parties, regardless of the mobility of the target    of the FBI's investigation, and without degradation of service.         ...under the proposal, the Department of Justice (DOJ) can keep    communications products off the market if it determines that    these products do not meet the DOJ's own ... guidelines. This    [could] result in increased costs and reduced competitiveness for    service providers and equipment manufacturers, since they will be    unlikely to add any features that may result in a DOJ rejection    of their entire product. ...the FBI proposal suggests that the    cost of this wiretapping 'service' to the Bureau would have to be    borne by the service provider itself...        The Electronic Frontier Foundation organized a broad coalition of    public interest and industry groups, from Computer Professionals    for Social Responsibilty (CPSR) and the ACLU to AT&T and Sun    Microsystems, to oppose the legislation. A white paper produced    by the EFF and ratified by the coalition, entitled, `An Analysis    of the FBI Digital Telephony Proposal,' was widely distributed    throughout the Congress.  ... The Justice Department lobbied hard    in the final days to get Congress to take up the bill before    Congress adjourned, but the bill never ... found a Congressional    sponsor (and was therefore never officially introduced). The FBI    [may] reintroduce ""Digital Telephony"" when the 103rd Congress    convenes in January.    ftp.eff.org   ===========      /pub/eff/legislation/fbi-wiretap-bill   /pub/EFF/legislation/new-fbi-wiretap-bill   ---     A bill to ensure the continuing access of law enforcement to the     content of wire and electronic communications when authorized by     law and for other purposes.

FOOTNOTES =========   _____ <7.1 What is the background behind the Internet?     The article ``Internet'' in Fantasy and Science Fiction by Bruce   Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us contains general and nontechnical   introductory notes on origins of the Internet, including the role   of the RAND corporation, the goal of network resilience in face of   nuclear attack, MIT, UCLA, ARPANET, TCP/IP, NSF, NREN, etc.:     ARPANET itself formally expired in 1989, a happy victim of its     own overwhelming success.  Its users scarcely noticed, for    ARPANET's  functions not only continued but steadily improved.     The use of  TCP/IP standards for computer networking is now    global.  In 1971, a  mere twenty-one years ago, there were only    four nodes in the  ARPANET  network.  Today there are tens of    thousands of  nodes in  the Internet,  scattered over forty-two    countries, with more coming  on-line every day.   Three million,    possibly four million people use  this gigantic    mother-of-all-computer-networks.           The Internet is especially popular among scientists, and is     probably the most important scientific instrument of the late     twentieth century.   The  powerful, sophisticated access that it     provides to specialized data and personal communication  has sped    up the pace of scientific research enormously.          The Internet's pace of growth in the early 1990s is  spectacular,     almost ferocious.  It is spreading faster than cellular phones,    faster  than fax machines.  Last year the Internet was growing at    a rate of  twenty percent a *month.*  The number of `host'    machines with direct  connection to TCP/IP has been doubling    every year since  1988.   The Internet is moving out of  its    original base in military and  research institutions,  into    elementary and high schools, as well as into  public libraries    and the commercial sector.

According to Bruce Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us:     The Internet's `anarchy' may seem strange or even unnatural,  but    it makes a certain deep and basic sense.  It's rather like the     `anarchy' of the English language.  Nobody rents English, and    nobody  owns English.    As an English-speaking person, it's up    to you to learn  how to speak English properly  and make whatever    use you please  of it (though the government provides certain    subsidies to help you  learn to read and write a bit).      Otherwise, everybody just sort of  pitches in, and somehow the    thing evolves on its own, and somehow  turns out workable.  And    interesting.   Fascinating, even.   Though a lot  of people earn    their living from using and exploiting  and teaching  English,    `English' as an institution is public property, a public good.      Much the same goes for the Internet.   Would English  be improved    if  the `The English Language, Inc.'  had a board of directors    and a chief  executive officer, or a President and a Congress?      There'd probably be  a lot fewer new words in English, and a lot    fewer new ideas.     _____ <7.3 Most Wanted list    Hopefully you have benefitted from this creation, compilation, and   condensation of information from various sources regarding privacy,   identity, and anonymity on the internet.

They're betting that you can't do this, even if you know N.  Even if you  know E, in fact, which they're trying to keep secret.  If you can find E  by grinding down the chip, presumably you can find F as well.  But we can't  do this right now with DES, even knowing the encryption method without  doing almost the whole 56-bit search.  That is not true, with chosen plaintext attacks DES keys can be determined without the full search.     Now suppose that I know F, (either legitimately or not),  If I know K (either because I am involved in the conversation, or I know U  for a party in the conversation), I may now be able to determine U for the  other party.    Again, they're betting that you can't find U given K -- i.e. they claim the  encryption is strong.  (Trust us...)  I am not willing to take that bet.   If I know F I can also defeat the law enforcement field, since I could  make my own, with a different K then the one I am using. Knowing F also  allows traffic analysis to be performed. So I might not know what you are  saying but I could know who you are saying it too.    I'm not sure there'll be a way to shove arbitrary key and data through your  chip, but if so, this part's OK.  (We're assuming E is unknown.)  You can obviously shove arbitrary data through your chip...... As for the key, it is stated that the sesion key exchange is external to the chip, so I can pick my keys too.   Now I admit that someone trying to compute U will not have lots of  messages to work from, but since we have no way of knowing that the key  generation method does not (deliberately?) generate weak keys, or for that  matter that the published method is in fact used, perhaps the U's will be  chosen from know weak keys for the system.    They assume that you won't be able to find U no matter how many messages  you have.  If <they could break U, they wouldn't need the key escrow.

Obviously the compromise of F would be a disaster, both to law enforcement  for whom this whole thing is designed, and for the people who believe that  it is giving them security. F is but one number, and I sure that alot of  people (more then 1) know what it is (and if some ""panel of experts"" is  going to check it over for flaws then many more will know F, forget  grinding chips, bribery and blackmail work just fine.

Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the    chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the    output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output    bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.     If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that    some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that    they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast,    DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible  the 50% output    change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think    NSA is going to cheat that crudely  they're likely to get caught.  Consider a cryptosytem that starts out by XORing bits 23 and 47, and not using either of these bits except through this XOR. This system makes early use of every bit. but an exhaustive key search would now only have 279 keys to search. Your test by varying single key bits wouldn't turn up anything interesting.     Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see    the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased    subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.  The algorithm I suggest above would stick out like a sore thumb, but I'm sure I could design a system with a more subtle key redundancy which was well-hidden, but would still make an exhaustive key search take far less than 280 encryptions.

sci_crypt;"From: sommerfeld@apollo.hp.com (Bill Sommerfeld) Subject: A little political philosophy worth reading.  Read this through once or twice.  Then replace ""prince"" with ""government"" or ""president"", as appropriate, and read it again.    [From Chapter XX of _The Prince_, by N. Macchiavelli, as translated by Daniel Donno.]  	In order to keep their lands secure, some princes have disarmed their subjects  others have prompted division within the cities they have subjugated.  Some have nurtured animosities against themselves  others have sought to win the approval of those they initially distrusted.  Some have erected fortresses  others have destroyed them.  Now, although it is impossible to set down definite judgements on all of these measures without considering the particular circumstances of the states where they may be employed, I shall nevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the subject itself will allow.  	To begin with, there has never been a case of a new prince disarming his subjects.  Indeed, whenever he found them disarmed, he proceeded to arm them.  For by arming your subjects, you make their arms your own.  Those among them who are suspicious become loyal, while those who are already loyal remain so, and from subjects they are transformed into partisans.  Though you cannot arm them all, nonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed by extending privileges to those you arm.  Your different treatment of the two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you, while the former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added duties and dangers should receive advantages.    	When you disarm your subjects, however, you offend them, by showing that, either from cowardliness or from lack of faith, you distrust them  and either conclusion will induce them to hate you. Moreover, since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed, you would have to resort to mercenaries, whose limitations have already been discussed. Even if such troops were good, however, they could never be good enough to defend you from powerful enemies, and doubtful subjects.  Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a newly acquired state has always taken measures to arm his subjects, and history is full of examples proving that this is so.  	But when a prince takes posession of a new state which he annexes as an addition to his original domain, then he must disarm all the subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquire it  and these, as time and occasion permit, he must seek to render soft and weak.  He must arrange matters in such a way that the arms of the entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native to his original domain.  	...  	And since the subject demands it, I will not fail to remind any prince who has acquired a new state by the aid of its inhabitants that he soundly consider what induced them to assist him  if the reason is not natural affection for him, but rather dissatisfaction with the former government, he will find it extremely difficult to keep them friendly, for it will be impossible to please them.  If he will carefully think the matter through in the light of examples drawn from ancient and modern affairs, he will understand why it is much easier to win the favor of those who were happy with their former government, and hence were his enemies, than to keep the favor of those who, out of dissatisfaction with the former rule, helped him to replace it."

Of those federal and federally funded candidate agencies that you mentioned, I have the following comments:  	- SRI, Rand, Mitre, and national labs: I agree that they have         great experience safeguarding sensitive information. I am not         convinced that they would adequately safeguard _this_ 	information, since in any case requiring disclosure, there's       	likely to be sigificant pressure for disclosure- possibly  	*wrongful* disclosure.  	- GAO: perhaps.

Myktotronx refers to it as ""Government Type II encryption"", which matches the  designation of one of the types of encryption available on STU-III phones,  and may be the same as a cryptosystem I have heard called ""CIPHER2"".  This would make sense, since this is evidently a field-proven cryptosystem  which can act as a ""pin-compatible"" substitute for DES.

If  there is a perceived need for cellular encryption, then the companies will  provide one.  Most likely, a standard will emerge.  But if the Clipper is  too expensive (and $25 a chip is way too much) then they will develope their  own or buy a cheaper one.    This is an interesting point.  As a VERY COARSE rule of thumb, you can figure that the final price of a product is 3 to 5 times the Cost Of Goods. (The exact multiplier depends largely on economies of scale: Products that sell tens of millions of units/year will be at the low end, those that sell thousands of units/year will be at the high end.  I suspect cellular phones are in the middle).  This implies that adding a $25 chip would increase the cost of the phone by approx $100, or about 25% - 30%.

sci_crypt;From: prz@sage.cgd.ucar.edu (Philip Zimmermann) Subject: Fighting the Clipper Initiative  Here are some ideas for those of you who want to oppose the White House Clipper chip crypto initiative.  I think this is going to be a tough measure to fight, since the Government has invested a lot of resources in developing this high-profile initiative.  They are serious about it now.  It won't be as easy as it was defeating Senate Bill 266 in 1991.  Possible actions to take in response:  1)  Mobilize your friends to to all the things on this list, and more.  2)  Work the Press.  Talk with your local newspaper's science and technology reporter.  Write to your favorite trade rags.  Better yet, write some articles yourself for your favorite magazines or newspapers.  Explain why the Clipper chip initiative is a bad idea.  Remember to tailor it to your audience.  The general public may be slow to grasp why it's a bad idea, since it seems so technical and arcane and innocent sounding.  Try not to come across as a flaming libertarian paranoid extremist, even if you are one.   3)  Lobby Congress.  Write letters and make phone calls to your Member of Congress in your own district, as well as your two US Senators.  Many Members of Congress have aides that advise them of technology issues.  Talk to those aides.  4)  Involve your local political parties.  The Libertarian party would certainly be interested.  There are also libertarian wings of the Democrat and Republican parties.  The right to privacy has a surprisingly broad appeal, spanning all parts of the political spectrum.  We have many natural allies.  The ACLU.  The NRA.  Other activist groups that may someday find themselves facing a government that can suppress them much more efficiently if these trends play themselves out.  But you must articulate our arguments well if you want to draw in people who are not familiar with these issues.  4)  Contribute money to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), assuming these groups will fight this initiative.  They need money for legal expenses and lobbying.  5)  Mobilize opposition in industry.  Companies that will presumably develop products that will incorporate the Clipper chip should be lobbied against it, from within and from without.  If you work for a telecommunications equipment vendor, first enlist the aid of your coworkers and fellow engineers against this initiative, and then present your company's management with a united front of engineering talent against this initiative.  Write persuasive memos to your management, with your name and your colleagues' names on it.  Hold meetings on it.  6)  Publicize, deploy and entrench as much guerrilla techno-monkeywrenching apparatus as you can.  That means PGP, anonymous mail forwarding systems based on PGP, PGP key servers, etc.  The widespread availability of this kind of technology might also be used as an argument that it can't be effectively suppressed by Government action.  I will also be working to develop new useful tools for these purposes.   7)  Be prepared to engage in an impending public policy debate on this topic.  We don't know yet how tough this fight will be, so we may have to compromise to get most of what we want.  If we can't outright defeat it, we may have to live with a modified version of this Clipper chip plan in the end.  So we'd better be prepared to analyze the Government's plan, and articulate how we want it modified.   -Philip Zimmermann

Furthermore, your D/A converter will probably not present you with a signal that has been cut off at 720 Hz, but will instead alias in all the higher frequencies.

I would guess that the availability of one of these 40-bit chunks and a reasonable key-search machine, would allow you to read the traffic. I'm not suggesting that this is a deliberate weakness of the system, but it does make you think.

Let the Crappy Chip live in infamy, and the adminstration receive great shame and discredit for this bizarre misadventure.  IMHO, encryption is (also) protected under the SECOND amendment of the Constitution of the United States.   I am outraged that my tax money is being used to develop technology to restrict my freedoms far beyond reasonable measures.  The U.S. government will have my full uncooperation and disobedience on any serious threat to my liberties such as this, and I call on everyone with an interest in a sensible government to resist and defy this  proposal.  The administration does not seem to understand that they are merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of the public, and hence anyone involved in this proposal in this respect is  wholly negligent and remiss in performing their lawful duty.  I am not surprised that this administration is doing this. I could have told you so.   Cryptography is neutral technology. If everybody has strong  cryptography (including policemen, bureacrats, businessmen,  housewives, thugs and hoodlums), we have a sustainable  equilibrium.  Anything less is an unworkable anti-egaltarian  arrangement, intrinsically antithetical to American freedoms, and guaranteed to collapse under its own weight of inherent  impracticality. We don't need to compromise on issues of freedom.  Privacy has ALWAYS been something that has the effect of restricting out ability to prosecute criminals.  We are supposed to have the presumption of innocence.  I have the right to pull the curtains over my windows and close my door, and the police may not come in.  If I perform a crim in my home, they will have to find out by means other than simply looking.  Encryption is to my data as the window curtains are to my home. Simple enough?   For too long our government has demonstrated itself to be  increasingly hostile and a serious obstacle to economic vitality  and protecting Americans.  And yet the people vote for these people because they come out a lie to them about promising to fix things.   The administration has to be committed to leaving private  industries alone, esp. on this issue.  The government has no  legitimate role in regulating the content of communications.

I will trade threats for threats, and violation for violation.  Perhaps the FIRST amendment.  Definitely the SECOND and FIFTH.   If the administration did say this, it would find itself  impeached for reckless and outrageous disregard of essential, established, entrenched, and explicit constitutional privacy  guarantees.

Unfortunately, the vast segments of the population are misinformed. They just haven't appended -SR to the name of out country, yet.   This is an outright Dingaling Denning lie.  The two aims of privacy and surveillance are intrinsically and fundamentally  incompatible, and you have to work for the NSA to think otherwise.  Americans are about to discover ways, through the use of technology,  to preserve their inalienable but forgotten freedoms that have slowly  been eroded away by an increasingly distant and unresponsive and  *unrepresentative* government.

Three questions: 1) It looks like each 64 bits of input gives you 4*64 bits of output: 		E[M K] = 64 bits 		E[K U] = E[ 80 bits ] = 128 bits 		E[ E[K U], N   F ] = E[ 128 + 30 bits ] = 192 bits    Do you really need to transmit all 256 bits each time,    or do you only transmit the 192 bits of wiretap block at the beginning?       All 256 would be really obnoxious for bandwidth-limited applications    like cellular phones (or even regular phones over   2) how do the 4 DES modes interact with the two-part output?    Do the various feedback modes only apply to the message block,    or also to the wiretap block?  Or, if the wiretap block is only    transmitted at the beginning, does it get incorporated into    everything through feedback modes, but not during ECB mode?  3) Does the Clipper Chip check the wiretap block itself?    Does the block have to be present at all?    Since the receiving chip doesn't know the transmitter's U,    it presumably can't check the validity of E[K U], so it's     limited to checking the *form* of the wiretap block,    and maybe checking the serial number for reasonableness    (unless there's some sort of back-door structure that lets    it recognize a valid E[K U].)        In that case, can you replace the wiretap block with a DIFFERENT    wiretap block, presumably an old valid one to avoid attracting attention?    (The chip won't do it, so you postprocess the output.)    Regular people can do one with their own serial number and a dummy key     paranoid people can use someone else's serial number.     On the other hand, if I could think of that solution so easily,    presumably the NSA could too - have they done something to block it,    like use message encryption that's really E[M  K,U,N] ?

The following program is a very quick hack I created a few months ago to determine whether a Sun Sparcstation IPC could perform real-time, full-duplex encrypted audio with resulting data rates sustainable by today's modems.  This test program reads linearly-encoded audio from the audio device, compresses it with GSM 06.10 (compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples recorded at 8kHz into 260 bits resulting in a 50 Hz frame rate), encrypts it with DES, then reverses the process and sends the reconstructed audio back to the audio device.  The compressed, encrypted audio stream is 13 kbits/s (!).  My Sparcstation IPC (not exactly a very fast machine these days, certainly slower than an ELC) would just barely sustain this activity (audio underruns would occcur but the speech was very intelligible).  I ran it as a real-time process to get the best results.  Remember, though, that this program is a quick hack and the performance can certainly be improved.  The audio compression routines can be ftp'd from tub.cs.tu-berlin.de, I believe (look for gsm or toast).  I used Eric Young's DES implementation but I no longer know where I got it from.

What else can you call a key deterministically generated from the serial number?    To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is    first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.    S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a    64-bit block R1:  	   R1 = E[D[E[N1  S1]  S2]  S1] .     Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and    N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:    	   R2 = E[D[E[N2  S1]  S2]  S1]  	   R3 = E[D[E[N3  S1]  S2]  S1] .     R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The    first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The    rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2    are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow    agencies.   What happens is that the need for the Escrow houses is completely eliminated. Or should I say, the need to _access_ the Escrow houses to decrypt the data. The houses will still serve a real purpose as far as generating the illusion of protection, and small-town cops won't be let in on the ""secret"", so they will still go through the motions of going to the Escrow houses, but the fact is __the Federal government CAN and WILL build a chip which generates the unit keys from the encrypted serial number!__  'Nuff Said."

It depends on the mode you're using.  For a single 64-bit input block, a one-bit error will have a 50 percent chance of corrupting each of the 64 output bits - in other words, it essentially turns the output block into a random number.  If you're encrypting data in CBC mode, however, only the one 64-bit block will be affected.  The next block, and all that follow it will be decrypted properly.

How much data per    bit will be lost in average (I assume you still have the correct key)?  It depends on the mode you're using DES in. Electronic Code Book (ECB) takes a block of 64 input bits and produces 64 output bits, so if any bits are changed, the entire block of 64 bits becomes bad. I forget which feedback mode is which. In all of them, the results of encrypting one block affect later blocks. With some modes, the system self-synchronizes, so errors are repaired in a few blocks.  With other modes, once one block is bad, all later blocks will be bad too.  There's also the framing problem.  If you have a bit change, the block that it's in changes, and maybe later blocks also change. But if you have bits lost or bits added (64 bits in, 63 or 65 bits out), everything is confused after that.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  From: Marcus J Ranum <mjr@TIS.COM  	depends on the mode you're using. cfb, for example, synchronises pretty fast. figure a bit error will destroy the current block and the next one.  mjr.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  --- Experience is what you get if you don't get what you want...

The test for compelled self-incrimination is whether the material to  be disclosed *in itself* tends to inculpate the discloser. In the example I gave above, the safe key itself has no testimonial value--ergo, it can be disclosed under compulsion (e.g., subpoena duces tecum).  Moreover, the government can always immunize the disclosure of a crypto key--compelling you to disclose the key at the price of not using the fact of your disclosure as evidence in the case against you.

Quite simply she says that the security should not DEPEND on the secrecy of the algorithm.  A secret algorithm can still be secure, after all, we just don't know it.  Only our level of trust is affected, not the security of the system.  The algorithm *could* be RSA for all we know, which we believe to be secure.  They have a much better reason to classify the algorithm than to protect its security.  They want to protect its market share.  If they publish the algorithm, then shortly manufacturers would make chips that implement the algorithm and standard but do not use a key stored in escrow.  And of course, everybody would buy them.   The whole push of this chip is that by establishing a standard that you can only use if you follow their rules, they get us to follow their rules without enacting new laws that we would fight tooth and nail.

Currently, when you send an encrypted message, an opponent can usually tell 1) that you are using encryption 2) which encryption method you are using [because that information is usually in the clear].  With clipper, most opponents will only know that you are sending clipper-text, they won't know that your clipper-text is itself encoded.

(was Re: text of White House announcement and Q&As on clipper chip encryption)  This announcement is somewhat disconcerting  it doesn't do anything evil in and of itself, but bodes badly for the future of open algorithms and standards in information security.  I won't start panicking until/unless DES or RSA or stuff like that is prohibited, but I'm a little anxious.  (No doubt it won't be long before someone posts explaining how this just a small part of some far-ranging and long-lived NSA-PKP-IRS-FBI-CIA-HandgunControlInc-Clinton conspiracy to subvert freedom, democracy, and mathematics.)  My feeling is that the administration probably isn't that worried about things like DES and RSA and PGP and RIPEM, since they'll never be used by a group much wider than us computer geeks.  The fact that this just came out now suggests one of two things:  1.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, and it only just     now happened to be ``ready'' to release to the world at this time.  2.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, but wasn't able     to get the Bush administration to go along with this plan.  (I     find it unlikely that this would have been because of a sympathy     for the unescrowed use of cryptography  more likely the     administration felt that even escrowed, secret-algorithm and, for     all we know, trivially breakable cryptography should not be made     widely available.)  Thus said clipper@csrc.ncsl.nist.gov (Clipper Chip Announcement): This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   The majority of the discussion involving this ""Clipper Chip"" seems to pertain to the encryption of telephone conversations.  Does anyone know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog signals?  The language sort of suggests this, but it's hard to say.  The main thing I just don't get is whether this chip implements symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic techniques.  Anybody know?  I'm guessing symmetric, but they don't get very clear about it.  If it is symmetric, how is it useful for anything other than link-level encryption with an identical chip at each end?  How can you negotiate a per-session key using symmetric cryptography without using a trusted third party who knows your key?  (Or does it even use a per-session key?)  If it's asymmetric, what about PKP's patents, which they claim cover all methods of doing asymmetric cryptography?

sci_crypt;From: fw@world.std.com (forrest d whitcher) Subject: SUMMARY: responses / research on oracle password security  My original post was:  I am building an oracle v6 database to serve as a repository for information which is considered proprietary or confidential. As such I want to verify the security of oracle passwords and apply some of the same security checking techniques we use on our *nix systems. Specifically I would like to use Crack, or something like it to check the encrypted data for easily guessed passwords.  The use of 'Crack' would depend on oracle using the unix password encryption scheme, does anyone know if this is the case, or what method is used?  Any other methods for security checking / audit in the oracle environment would be much appreciated.  This article will just scratch the surface of a few security considerations, comments are requested. (email: fw@world.std.com) My thanks to the people who responded, both on usenet and from Oracle Corp.  The most common response was to suggest use of oracle audit  features or OPS$ passwords to control access (opinion on OPS$ included suggestions to use and not use). I was also advised to  use table views to refine the granularity of access control.  One important security consideration in networked installations is that OPS$ accounts presume that the client host provides user authentication. Os/2 server OPS$ users are only as secure as the  _least_ secure machine on the network. Hence you should probably  not define any OPS$ accounts on systems with PC's, or limit access  of OPS$ accounts to data with no security concerns. Unix oracle  servers provide for disabling OPS$ access over the network (orasrv option), while relying on host security for local processes.   Internally Oracle provides powerful and well documented (sic)  audit mechanisms which the DBA will use to monitor system and data access. These tools can be used to track the primary security risks from within the Oracle environment.  Oracle password security is based on a proprietary usage of DES encryption. Oracle Corp. states that the algorithm is not prone to cleartext attack. This is a difficult claim to substantiate  since the algorithm is unknown. The concern here is that if users  choose easily guessed passwords. _If_ a cracker can gain access  to your oracle database files through the host operating system,  s/he could extract the 'cyphertext' password data and apply  cryptanalysis techniques to learn the users passwords.  As security risks go, the above scenario is pretty low severity. Certainly once an intruder has access to the raw database files, s/he can access to the data in them. If a cracker _could_ break  the passwords, however, s/he could do substantial damage without alerting the auditing mechanism's, and leaving and audit trail which would point to valid users. At present Oracle (like Unix) provides no native means of ensuring that passwords are not  guessable.   As with all computer security, the most important defense is to  educate users in the safe choice of passwords. These techniques are well discussed in internet rfc#1281 and the Crack manual,  (both available from ftp archive servers) and, UNIX(R) System  Security (Curry, David A. - Addison-Welsey 1992)     Forrest Whitcher                 fw@world.std.com Boston Scientific Corp.

However, using the info they gather while listening, they can go searching THE right place and find good, strong evidence, which they can use in court.   Question : currently, it is easy to wire-tap, from the technical point of view, at least. Anybody using the appropriate radio receiver can listen to communications between a car-telephone and the ground station. The police also, obviously. The clipper chip will make it much more difficult for the non-authorized person to eavesdrop (note that I DO NOT write << impossible ). The privacy will thus improve from the current situation. Poeple who REALLY have something to hide already DO NOT use the phone to speak of these things. If an illegal operation is really worth, one can afford having critical data carried by a person rather than sending it electronically.  The clipper chip will not change this.   The problem is more politic. Foreign countries will never accept the clipper chip is the access to the escrow cannot be directly granted to their own police following their OWN law, not the US law. i.e. each country will have its own escrow. How then will it be possible to monitor the international traffic? or, will encrypted international traffic be possible ? or will there be an international escrow, some kind of U.N. thing ?  Forbidding crypted communication is impractical: how is it possible to spot a crypted communication in the thousands of megabytes of data which circulate on the various existing networks. What about private networks ? And this will be more and more impossible as the volume of electronic traffic will increrase in the next years.  I think that the clipper chip can only be an interesting device to limit the risk of , for instance, one's girlfriend's husband listening to his wife's communications. It will bring no more as regards to security. Is it worth ? I think so if its cost is limited, I think that many privacy invasions are done not only by official services, but also by private entities. The clipper can help reducing these. Provided we do not hope too much of it, it is not a real danger and it can be helpful.  Ph. HOOGVORST

While I was in grad school, a friend of mine got a  security clearance to work on the defense for the Progressive magazine.

So the lawyers sent him all over the states to other libraries to show that the information in the article was already public.  What pissed everyone off was a local underground paper went and published the article anyway (it had been precensored by the feds, that's what this was all about) so the judge declared the case moot.  The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 has never been tested in court.  From my discussions with several people familiar with the case, only 2 other times has this preemptive clause been used.  In every case the people simply did what they felt like and courts tossed the cases out.  For all intents and purposes, the government *does* have precidence for declaring things classified *after* it has been published.  While I was working on Star Wars this happened to me: my clearance was in the works and I developed a method for tracking particle beams.  It was good enough to classify, so I was no longer allowed to work on it.  A friend from Canada was in the same boat: he developed a method to compute stripping cross sections, but because the subject was classified *he was not allowed to present his own paper at a conference!*.  He later published it in an open journal without problems.  When the going gets wierd, the wierd turn pro.

Getting rid of the keys is actually pretty easy to do automatically on a communications link, as opposed to storage where the keys have to be retained somehow as long as the owner wants to be able to retrieve the data.  The right way to do communications security is to generate a random session key with Diffie Hellman, use it for a while and then destroy it. Once it's gone, there's no getting it back, and no way to decrypt recordings of the conversation.  To make sure you aren't being attacked by a man in the middle, you have to authenticate your DH exchanges. The AT&T secure phone does this by displaying the DH key so you can compare them verbally over the phone. This is nice and simple, but it relies on user awareness plus the inability of the man in the middle to duplicate the users' voices.  A better way is to authenticate the exchanges with RSA. Since you'd never use RSA for actual encryption, compromising your RSA secret key would only allow someone to impersonate you in a future conversation, and even that only until you revoke your public key.  They would still not be able to decrypt recordings of prior conversations for which the session keys have been destroyed.  I'm convinced that this is how the government's own secure phones (the STU-III) must work. Neat, eh?  Phil

If the government didn't intend to outlaw other forms of encryption, than Clipper is just a big waste of time and money. Why, you ask?

sci_crypt;From: koontzd@phobos.lrmsc.loral.com (David Koontz ) Subject: Re: Will FEDs troll for mutilated law enforcement blocks?  The M code stream  might be independently attacked based on knowledge of clipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext.  This could be invalidated by changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper M stream and the actual transmitted stream, under the control of a secure key generator synchronized between endpoints.  The useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited based on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission interception.  You would need a large number of them, but, hey there's supposed to be millions of these things, right?  Adding time stamps to the encrypted law enforcement block is probably impractical, who wants an encryption chip with a real time clock?  *****************************************************************************  The entire idea of the law enforcement block can be invalidated.  I just had the thought, that you could capture your own law enforcement blocks for session keys K that you will not use in actual transmissions as the session key authenticators.  The proviso that you don't mind your own serial number being discovered.  d. denning just sent out further information of a new version of the clipper chip.	If a hash function were to be embedded in a clipper M transmission block reflecting the law enforcement block, it better not fall on 64 bit block boundaries.  If it were a recognizeable datum, you could lie with it too.  I like the randomizer inclusion in the MYK-80.  I remember reading that Intel had an approved random noise source on silicon, hence the ability to put it Inside.

As Brad Templeton and others have noted, once the Clipper becomes ensconced in enough phones there will be enormous pressure to make it the *legal* standard, and it will become the ""market* standard as well. (There is a lot of confusion in the proposal about whether the use of Clipper is mandated, about whether non-escrow alternatives will be allowed, etc.)  (There are also unclear issues about how hard, or how illegal, it will be to make ""workalikes"" which meet the standard but which generate phony or untappable keys...I'm sure the next several weeks will see these issues thrashed out in this and other groups.)  Meanwhile, I'd be interested to hear RSA Data Security's reaction. Often criticized in this group for their licensing policies (the usual complaints about MailSafe costing too much, at $125 or so, and the general issue of software patents...), we may find that *allying* ourselves with RSA is the best thing we can do. What's a mere licensing fee when our liberty may be at stake? (If everyone who wanted true security paid, say, $100 for a lifetime use of all of RSA's patents--which expire in the period 1998-2002, or so--then RSA would make tons of money and be happy, I'm sure. A small price to pay. For those to whom $100 sounds like too much, I'm sure the actual terms could be different, spread out over several years, whatever. To me, it's a small price to pay.)  Strong crypto means strong privacy. Escrowing keys, sending copies of keys to large databases, and splitting keys into two 40-bit pieces, all done with secret and non-analyzable protocols and algorithms, is *NOT* strong crypto!  Whatever some of us may think about the abstract principles of patenting number theory applications, this minor issue pales in comparison with the potential dangers of the Clipper proposal (note that I said ""potential""...we'll presumably learn more in the coming months).  The RSA algorithms are at least public, have been analyzed and attacked for years, and source code is available (to better ensure no deliberate weakenesses or trapdoors).  I know of a number of groups putting together voice encryption systems using off-the-shelf hardware (like Soundblaster boards for the PC) and CELP-type software. The new generations of PCs, using fast 486s and Pentiums are fast enough to do real-time voice encryption. Combined with Diffie-Hellman key exchange, this should provide an alternative to the Clipper system.  Of course, we don't really know if the Administration proposes to outlaw competing systems. (It seems to me that their goal of tapping terrorists, child pornographers, and Hilary bashers would be thwarted if low-cost alternatives to Clipper proliferated. Not to defend child pornographers or terrorists, but limiting basic freedoms to catch a few criminals is not the American way of doing things. End of soapbox mode.)  I suggest we in these groups set aside any differences we may have had with RSA (and don't look at me....I have both MacPGP *and* a fully legal copy of ""MailSafe""!) and instead work with them as quickly as we can.

For those of you who might want to mangle the L.E. block (e.g. by xor-ing  a constant pattern) on the transmission line and restore it before feeding  it into the receiving Crippler Chip I would add further encrypted copies  of this block (perhaps created by repeated application of the encryption  algorithm or so) at regular intervals during the transmission.

Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.

The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers every 21 days.   Contents  * How do I recover from lost passwords in WordPerfect? * How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher? * How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX?

WordPerfect encryption has been shown to be very easy to break.   The method uses XOR with two repeating key streams: a typed password   and a byte-wide counter initialized to 1+<the password length. Full   descriptions are given in Bennett [BEN87] and Bergen and Caelli   [BER91].    Chris Galas writes: ``Someone awhile back was looking for a way to   decrypt WordPerfect document files and I think I have a solution.    There is a software company named: Accessdata (87 East 600 South,   Orem, UT 84058), 1-800-658-5199 that has a software package that will   decrypt any WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, Quatro-Pro, MS Excel and Paradox   files. The cost of the package is $185. Steep prices, but if you   think your pw key is less than 10 characters, (or 10 char) give them a   call and ask for the free demo disk. The demo disk will decrypt files   that have a 10 char or less pw key.''  * How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher?    A repeated-key cipher, where the ciphertext is something like the   plaintext xor KEYKEYKEYKEY (and so on), is called a Vigenere cipher.   If the key is not too long and the plaintext is in English, do the   following:     1. Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences.   (See Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].) Trying each displacement of   the ciphertext against itself, count those bytes which are equal.    If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key, something   over 6% of the bytes will be equal. If they have used different   key, then less than 0.4% will be equal (assuming random 8-bit bytes   of key covering normal ASCII text). The smallest displacement which   indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key.    2. Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself. This   removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself. Since   English has about 1 bit of real information per byte, 2 streams of   text XORed together has 2 bits of info per 8-bit byte, providing   plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption. (And in fact   one stream of text XORed with itself has just 1 bit per byte.)    If the key is short, it might be even easier to treat this as a   standard polyalphabetic substitution. All the old cryptanalysis   texts show how to break those. It's possible with those methods, in   the hands of an expert, if there's only ten times as much text as key.   See, for example, Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].  * How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP, RIPEM, PEM, ...]    Here's one popular method, using the des command:      cat file | compress | des private_key | uuencode | mail    Meanwhile, there is a de jure Internet standard in the works called   PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). It is described in RFCs 1421 through   1424. To join the PEM mailing list, contact pem-dev-request@tis.com.   There is a beta version of PEM being tested at the time of this   writing.    There are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting   mail: PGP and RIPEM.  Both are available by FTP.  Each has its own   newsgroup: alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem.  Each has its own FAQ   as well.    PGP is most commonly used outside the USA since it uses the RSA algorithm   without a license and RSA's patent is valid only (or at least primarily)   in the USA.    RIPEM is most commonly used inside the USA since it uses the RSAREF which   is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside   the USA.    Since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of   the message (PGP used IDEA  RIPEM uses DES) and RSA for encrypting the   message key, they should be able to interoperate freely.  Although there   have been repeated calls for each to understand the other's formats and   algorithm choices, no interoperation is available at this time (as far as   we know).  * Is the UNIX crypt command secure?    No. See [REE84]. There is a program available called cbw (crypt   breaker's workbench) which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks   on files encrypted with crypt. One source for CBW is [FTPCB].  * How do I use compression with encryption?    A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by   some simple encryption method (e.g., XOR with a repeated key).    Unfortunately, you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact   distribution of possible inputs. For all practical purposes it's   impossible to describe ``the typical English text'' beyond coarse   characteristics such as single-letter frequencies. You can build up   more and more sophisticated models of your inputs, but if the enemy   has a slightly more accurate model, he'll be able to find some   redundancy in your compressed output.    Note that nearly all practical compression schemes, unless they   have been designed with cryptography in mind, produce output that   actually starts off with high redundancy. For example, the output of   UNIX compress begins with a well-known three-byte ``magic number''   that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis.      This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a   bad idea  it just has to be done very, very carefully, and by no means   removes the need for strong encryption.    Compression after encryption is silly.  * Is there an unbreakable cipher?    Yes. The one-time pad is unbreakable  see part 4. Unfortunately the   one-time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as   plaintext.    Of course, a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be   useful. Rather, it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by   likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is   expected to remain valid.  * What does ``random'' mean in cryptography?    Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom   number generator than most applications. For a source of bits to be   cryptographically random, it must be computationally impossible to   predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of   the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of   0th through N-1st bits, for all N up to the lifetime of the source.    A software generator (also known as pseudo-random) has the function   of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently   random bits.  This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by   the opponent.  Ideally, it should also be truly random (perhaps   generated by a hardware random number source).    Those who have Sparcstation 1 workstations could, for example,   generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of   entropy, by not connecting anything to it.  For example,  	cat /dev/audio | compress - foo    gives a file of high entropy (not random but with much randomness in   it).  One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key,   for example, to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random   string.    When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy, it is   important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that   because it looks complicated to a human, it must be ""random"".  For   example, disk operation completion times sound like they might be   unpredictable (to many people) but a spinning disk is much like a   clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy.  * What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?    See [SHA49]. The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount   of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information (entropy) in   the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number   of ciphertext bits used. Ciphertexts significantly longer than this   can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment. This is used to   back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis.    Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have   multiple, equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security   from the opponent's difficulty choosing the correct one.    Unicity distance, like all statistical or information-theoretic   measures, does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives   probabilistic results: namely, the minimum amount of ciphertext   for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible   plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext, when all possible keys   are tried for the decryption. Working cryptologists don't normally   deal with unicity distance as such. Instead they directly determine   the likelihood of events of interest.    Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters. If fewer than   D ciphertext characters have been intercepted, then there is not   enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of   possible keys. DES has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters,   which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks (each block corresponds to   8 ASCII characters). This may seem alarmingly low at first, but   the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work   required to find the key after approximately D characters have been   intercepted.    In fact, actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used   in discussing unicity distance. (Like other measures such as key   size, unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if   it's too small, but doesn't guarantee security if it's high.) Few   practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis  all   manner of characteristics might serve as entering ``wedges'' to crack   some cipher messages. However, similar information-theoretic   considerations are occasionally useful, for example, to determine a   recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem.   Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and   information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most   promising directions.    Unfortunately, most literature on the application of information   statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified, even the seminal   1940 work of Alan Turing (see [KOZ84]). For some insight into the   possibilities, see [KUL68] and [GOO83].  * What is key management and why is it important?    One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in   full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system,   and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption. (Of   course, one would assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling   Mossad about its cryptosystems, but Mossad probably finds out anyway.)   Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can   eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress. Thus, especially in   modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are   transferred, both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but   also enough key material to cover the traffic.    Key management refers to the distribution, authentication, and   handling of keys.    A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology   is the STU III secure telephone unit, which for classified use   employs individual coded ``Crypto Ignition Keys'' and a central Key   Management Center operated by NSA. There is a hierarchy in that   certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control   personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and   to perform installation/maintenance functions, such as the   reporting of lost CIKs.    This should give an inkling of the extent of the key management   problem. For public-key systems, there are several related issues,   many having to do with ``whom do you trust?''  * Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?    Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from   relatively compact generators. Perhaps the simplest example is a   linear congruential sequence, one of the most popular types of random   number generators, where there is no obvious dependence between seeds   and outputs. Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will, in a   high enough dimension, show up as a regular lattice. Mathematically   this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for   cryptanalysts to exploit. More complicated generators have more   complicated structure, which is why they make interesting pictures---   but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable   structure at all.    See [KNU81], exercise 3.5-7  [REE77]  and [BOY89].  * What is the correct frequency list for English letters?    There are three answers to this question, each slightly deeper than   the one before. You can find the first answer in various books:   namely, a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of   English text. Of course any such list will be ``correctly'' computed,   but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken.    The second answer is that the question doesn't make sense. What do   you mean by ``English letters''? The ``English language'' is not a   fixed, finite, closed object that can be exactly characterized. It   has changed over time  it is different between different authors.   Any particular message will have different statistics from those of   the language as a whole.    The third answer is that yes, no particular message is going to have   exactly the same characteristics as English in general, but for all   reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won't matter.   In fact there's an entire field called ``Bayesian statistics'' (other   buzzwords are ``maximum entropy methods'' and ``maximum likelihood   estimation'') which studies questions like ``What's the chance that a   text with these letter frequencies is in English?'' and comes up with   reasonably robust answers.    So make your own list from your own samples of English text. It will   be good enough for practical work, if you use it properly.  * What is the Enigma?    ``For a project in data security we are looking for sources of   information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by   the British during WWII.''    See [WEL82], [DEA85], [KOZ84], [HOD83], [KAH91].  * How do I shuffle cards?    Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of   values, using a random or pseudo-random function.  All possible output   permutations of this process should be equally likely.  To do this, you   need a random function (modran(x)) which will produce a uniformly   distributed random integer in the interval [0..x-1].  Given that   function, you can shuffle with the following [C] code: (assuming ARRLTH   is the length of array arr[] and swap() interchanges values at the two   addresses given)    for ( n = ARRLTH-1  n  0   n-- ) swap( &arr[modran( n+1 )], &arr[n] )      modran(x) can not be achieved exactly with a simple (ranno() % x) since   ranno()'s interval may not be divisible by x, although in most cases the   error will be very small.  To cover this case, one can take ranno()'s   modulus mod x, call that number y, and if ranno() returns a value less   than y, go back and get another ranno() value.   * Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM?    Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CD-ROM with   possibly multiple pieces of software, perhaps with each encrypted   separately, and will want to use different keys for each user (perhaps   even good for only a limited period of time) in order to avoid piracy.    As far as we know, this is impossible, since there is nothing in standard   PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the   keyboard.  If there were such an identification, then the CD-ROM could be   encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in   part on the unique identifier.  However, in this case the CD-ROM is one   of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose.    If the CD-ROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced, there must   be a key (or set of keys) for that encryption produced at some stage in   the process.  That key is useable with any copy of the CD-ROM's data.   The pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the   illegal copy.   * Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers?    schneier@chinet.chi.il.us (Bruce Schneier) says: AccessData of Orem,   Utah sells products that break the password scheme of a number of   popular Macintosh and PC software packages.

The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is 16 Mbits a second.  Each chip includes the following components:     the Skipjack encryption algorithm    F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips    N, a 30-bit serial number    U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip   ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP  To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure conversation, my security device will negotiate a session key K with the device at the other end (in general, any method of key exchange can be used).  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:     E[M  K], the encrypted message stream, and     E[E[K  U] + N  F], a law enforcement block.    The law enforcement block thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family key F.   CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW  All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (secure computer information facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at Mikotronx.  At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters an 80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters an 80-bit value S2. These values serve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1. S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a 64-bit block R1:          R1 = E[D[E[N1  S1]  S2]  S1] .  Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:            R2 = E[D[E[N2  S1]  S2]  S1]          R3 = E[D[E[N3  S1]  S2]  S1] .  R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies.  As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent 2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips. After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind.   The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2, and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to the escrow agencies.  The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or both may be independent from the government.   LAW ENFORCEMENT USE  When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with Clipper.  They will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the family key F.  This gives them E[K  U] + N.  They will then take a warrant identifying the chip serial number N to each of the key escrow agents and get back U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce the unit key U, and E[K  U] is decrypted to get the session key K. Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder operated by the FBI.   ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND DISTRIBUTION NOTICE.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to    accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure    telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.     For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our    private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the    tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of    protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate    the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and    law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against    industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.     Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to    protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to    protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption    technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the    unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used    by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.     A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the ""Clipper Chip"" has    been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a    new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,    relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to    an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications    using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in    commercial use today.     This new technology will help companies protect proprietary    information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations    and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted    electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the    ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to    intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.      A ""key-escrow"" system will be established to ensure that the    ""Clipper Chip"" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding    Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique   				   2      ""keys,"" numbers that will be needed by authorized government    agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the    device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately    in two ""key-escrow"" data bases that will be established by the    Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to    government officials with legal authorization to conduct a    wiretap.     The ""Clipper Chip"" technology provides law enforcement with no    new authorities to access the content of the private    conversations of Americans.     To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the    Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new    devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the    government will be offered access to the confidential details of    the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report    their findings.     The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of    encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the    privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield    criminals and terrorists.  We need the ""Clipper Chip"" and other    approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access    to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it    to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology    trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),    the President has directed government agencies to develop a    comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:  	--   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to 	     employ voice or data encryption for business purposes   	--   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone 	     calls and data, under proper court or other legal 	     order, when necessary to protect our citizens   	--   the effective and timely use of the most modern 	     technology to build the National Information 	     Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and 	     the competitiveness of American industry in the global 	     marketplace  and   	--   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export 	     high technology products.     The President has directed early and frequent consultations with    affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the    privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.    				   3     The Administration is committed to working with the private    sector to spur the development of a National Information    Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer    technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to    information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks    (""information superhighways"") will transmit video, images, HDTV    programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone    system transmits voice.     Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important    role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act    quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding    its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that    protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting    them from those who break the law.     Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.     The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new    encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  ""Clipper Chip"" technology provides law enforcement with 	no new authorities to access the content of the private 	conversations of Americans.     Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on 	a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation 	encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to 	decipher the message?     A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a 	court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They 	would then present documentation of this authorization to 	the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and 	obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug 	smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are 	stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key 	escrow system.     Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?     A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent 	entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the 	Administration have yet to determine which agencies will 	oversee the key-escrow data banks.     Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure 	how strong the security is?       A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption 	systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will 	remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow 	system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of 	cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all 	potential users that there are no unrecognized 	vulnerabilities.     Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?     A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the 	Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in 	this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the 	President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet 	officials.     Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?     A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on 	encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify 	as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have 	briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the 	decisions related to this initiative.     Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?     A:   The government designed and developed the key access 	encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the 	microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product 	manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip 	manufacturer that produces them.     Q:   Who provides the ""Clipper Chip""?     A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance, 	California, and will sell the chip to encryption device 	manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed 	to other vendors in the future.     Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?      A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating 	the ""Clipper Chip"" into their devices.     Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological 	solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be 	willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more 	powerful encryption devices?     A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be 	considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow 	mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product 	that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive 	than others readily available today, but it is just one 	piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to 	encryption technology, which the Administration is 	developing.  	The Administration is not saying, ""since encryption 	threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement, 	we will prohibit it outright"" (as some countries have 	effectively done)  nor is the U.S. saying that ""every 	American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an 	unbreakable commercial encryption product.""  There is a 	false ""tension"" created in the assessment that this issue is 	an ""either-or"" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be, 	and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned, 	balanced approach such as is proposed with the ""Clipper 	Chip"" and similar encryption techniques.     Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton 	Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from 	that of the Bush Administration?       A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption 	technology in telecommunications and computing and are 	committed to working with industry and public-interest 	groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans' 	privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law 	enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime 	and terrorism.     Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use 	the government hardware?     A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control 	requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is 	required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The 	same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the 	attractions of this technology is the protection it can give 	to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this 	in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a 	case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these 	devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan 	to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability 	of these products."

There are a lot of things that one cannot do in the USA. You may not  notice them, but as an Australian visitor, I notice them.      Of course don't over react --- but don't under react.   Thank you Andrew.  Not only for the firm rebuttal, but for understanding the  difference between communism and socialism (even though this is off topic). Why do people just not understand that just because all those pretty songs about the land of the free and so on sound nice, that they may not be true?

We thought there might be a market for a monitor which was not as hugely expensive as the military Tempest kit, but which was well enough shielded to stop eavesdropping using available receivers. We built a prototype, it works, and it's still sitting on my lab bench. Commercial interest was exactly zero.  In the absence of open standards, a monitor which really is `low radiation' (and costs 500 dollars more) can't compete against a monitor which just claims to be `low radiation' (and whose only extra cost of production is the pretty blue sticker on the box).

Brown Secretary Department of Commerce 14th and Pennsylvania Ave., NW Washington, DC 20236  Dear Secretary Brown:     As you know, I have long been interested in the privacy  and security of telecommunications transmissions and data in  a networked environment.  Recent reports concerning the  Administration's endorsement of an electronic encryption  standard, based upon ""clipper chip"" technology, have raised a  number of related issues.  The international competitiveness  of U.S. high tech manufacturers and the software industry is  a key factor that the government should consider when  addressing issues of encryption and data security.  As the  nation moves forward in developing the national  communications and information infrastructure, security of  telecommunications transmissions and network data will be an  increasingly important factor for protecting the privacy of  users.     The ""hacker"" community can compromise the integrity of  telecommunications transmissions and databases linked by the  network.  The people and businesses that use the nation's  telecommunications network and the personal computers linked  through it increasingly are demanding that information be  protected against unauthorized access, alteration, and theft.     I am concerned that the Administration's plan may mean  that to remain competitive internationally, U.S. companies  would be compelled to develop two products -- one for U.S.  government customers, and another for private, commercial  users who may want a higher encryption standard.  This may  inadvertently increase costs to those U.S. companies hoping  to serve both markets.  To assist the Subcommittee's analysis  of this issue, please respond to the following questions:  1. Has the encryption algorithm or standard endorsed by the  Administration been tested by any entity other than NSA, NIST  or the vendor?  If so, please identify such entities and the  nature of testing performed.  If not, please describe any  plans to have the algorithm tested by outside experts and how  such experts will be chosen.  2. Under the Administration's plan, what entities will be the  holders of the ""keys"" to decrypt scrambled data?  What  procedures or criteria will the Administration utilize to  designate such key holders?  3. Does the encryption algorithm endorsed by the  Administration contain a ""trap door"" or ""back door,"" which  could allow an agency or entity of the Federal government to  crack the code?  4. It is clear that over time, changes in technologies used  for communications will require new techniques and additional  equipment.

sci_crypt;"From: pmetzger@snark.shearson.com (Perry E. Metzger) Subject: The Escrow Database.  Here is a disturbing thought.  Now, we no longer live in the days of big filing cabinets. We live in the electronic age. I asked myself, how big could the escrow database get? How hard might it be to steal the whole thing, particularly were I an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the escrow houses? (We can pretend that such will not happen, but thats naive.)  Well, lets see. Ten bytes of each escrow half. Lets asume ten bytes of serial number -- in fact, I believe the serial number is smaller, but this is an order of magnitude calculation. We assume 250*106 as the population, and that each person has a key. I get five gigabytes for each of the two escrow databases. Fits conveniently on a single very valuable Exabyte tape. This can only get easier with time, but who cares -- I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my pocket on two 8mm tapes.  Admittely, they will think of safeguards. They won't put the whole database on one disk, prehaps. Maybe they will throw stumbling blocks in the way. This changes nothing -- they keys will be needed every day by hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types, so convenience will dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval. At some point, with or without collusion by the agencies, those exabyte tapes are going to get cut. Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight will doubtless claim this can't happen -- but we know that ""can't"" is a prayer, not a word that in this instance connotes realism.  With two exabyte tapes in your pocket, you would hold the keys for every person's conversations in the country in your hands. Yeah, you need the ""master key"" two -- but thats just ten bytes of information that have to be stored an awful lot of places.  Come to think of it, even if the NSA getting a copy of the database isn't a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial political views, consider foreign intelligence services. You know, the ones that David Sternlight wants to protect us from because of the evil industrial espionage that they do. The French apparently do have a big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrial secrets, so he isn't being completely irrational here (although why our companies couldn't use cryptosystems without back doors is left unexplained by those that point out this threat.)   Presumably, foreign intelligence services can get moles into the NSA and other agencies. We have proof by example of this: its happened many times. Presumably, someday they will get their hands on some fraction of the keys. You can't avoid that sort of thing.  Don't pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on the escrow databases.  We crypto types are all taught something very important at the beginning of intro to cryptography -- security must depend on the easily changed key that you pick to run your system, and not on a secret. The escrow databases aren't the sorts of secrets that our teachers told us about, but they are the sort of big secrets they would lump into this category. Imagine trying to replace 100 million Clipper chips.  I cannot believe that the NSA or whomever it is thats doing this doesn't realize all this already. They are too smart. There are too many of them who have made their bones in the real world. I suspect that they know precisely what they are doing -- and that what they are doing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continue to surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography. I suspect that they realize that they can't put things off forever, but they can try to delay things as long as possible.  Who knows. Maybe even some of the higher ups, the inevitable bureaucratic types that rise in any organization, really do believe that this scheme might give people some security, even as their subordinates in Fort Meade wring their hands over the foolishness of it all.  -- Perry Metzger		pmetzger@shearson.com -- Laissez faire, laissez passer.

Is the Clipper chip going to be exported?  If not, how will people communicate with other countries?  Will they have to do that in un-crypt-mode.  Will other encryption techniques be legal (assuming the government cracks down on using others) when going overseas, but not within the states?  2.  I've read about authentication systems that use an electronic   security card that looks like a calculator to create an encrypted PIN based on the time/date.  The host system has the algorithm built into it as well so that it can authenticate a user. Is there some form of encryption technology that would create keys that are only valid at a certain instant in time?  The  systems would then allow a ""window"" of time around this instant where the key would work. I realize that this technique would increase the amount of information needing to be stored because you would need entire algorithms rather than just keys.  But for smaller scale things it might work. Could some similar method be used to make the two 80-bit keys that are issued to police/FBI/etc to tap a phone only usable for one-week (for instance).  If further surveilance was needed, they would have to go back to the escrow service to get another key.  This would make it useless for local police to database keys they have used.  I assume this is not possible because the receiving phone would need to be able to decypher the message.  But any thoughts on the subject?  Thanks, Tauren Mills  Tauren Mills tauren@rigel.cs.pdx.edu"

In this case, the woman was suspected of having murdered the kid, so taking the 5th wasn't surprising. Sure, so she was probably guilty, but that's not good enough. In our system you're not supposed to be able to force a suspect to confess to a crime, no matter how strongly you think they're guilty.  You have to develop your evidence independently. Doing otherwise might catch a few more crooks, but only at the cost of turning the clock back to the middle ages, when confessions were routinely tortured out of suspects both guilty and innocent.

Thus if the father sued for custody of the children, the case would be civil and the defendant mother would not have fifth amendment protection. Oddly enough, her refusal to give information in a civil case can lead to criminal contempt charges (thus landing her in jail.)  The interesting part of all this is that in a murder trial, the woman CAN plead the fifth as  to the location of the child--this is routine.  A ""computer crime""  prosecution thus would seem to be fertile ground for this kind of defense,  where a suit by a party injured by ""hackers"" would not.  If I am accused,  for example, of sending encrypted kiddie porn over the nets the fifth should  protect my key.  If I am accused of sending copyrighted material, however, it proabably will not (copyright infringement not being a ""crime"" in the technical sense.)

And does the phone company require written, subpoena-able evidence of probable cause in order to process the request?  I suggest that the officer was disinterested in pursuing your case -- even if you could prove the offender had called you at a certain time, your  chances of winning a harassment suit on the strength of this evidence are nil.

Communiques intended by the group for non-attendees could of course just be signed using the private key but otherwises not encrypted.

First, it would be easier to archive for people who might join a group ""late"" and who might like to easily read earlier posts  second, traffic analysis to know exactly to whom an affinity message is directed would be foiled  three, a newsgroup is much more public and would serve to publicize available privacy measures on the internet.

My opinion, FWIW, to all:  Mark, age doesn't matter  ability does. I would rather have the untried rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven himself to be average at best. I don't care if he is 15  if he plays better than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decent minor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las Vegas in particular  he should have been projected as an average major league hitter (which is good for a catcher, I'll admit). Santiago's numbers would probably come out the same as Sandy's, but I don't have the league data from the mid-80s to check it out.  That being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to start the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league season in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very poorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhill are not complete mediocrities  for catchers, especially NL catchers, they are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around .220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs on the Braves  but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was just as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87. One year at any level, at any age, doesn't satisfy MY standards of evidence.

But he has a combined 720 OPS in minor league play  with his speed is more valuable than the OPS alone indicates  and at a still young age (24), had a monster year with an 868 OPS. He has a total, major and minor, EQA of .249  above major league average, and above average for CF (which was about .240 in the NL last year). He has shown at least the potential of going into the .290s, which would make him one of the 15 best hitters in the league. He has two full seasons before reaching his ""prime"" season of 27.

Besides, Wade just doesn't have any range.  What a shame about     Charlie Hayes, huh? Who would you have playing 3B, Wade Boggs or Charlie Hayes?  My choice is Boggs.  No contest.  It will give them time to develop younger talent in an area the Yankee farm system seems to be deficient.  A-hem. Two words: Russell Davis. Playing in the cavern at Albany (AA) last year (375/410/385 down the alleys and to center), Davis went .285/.355/.483 with 22 homers. There aren't any small parks on the road in the Eastern League, either. He's 23(!) and his MLE was .258/.308/.416, 17 HR. I have no fielding statistics, but from seeing him a number of times last year I'd say that he's not Brooks Robinson, but neither is he Howard Johnson. Unless they think they can win the pennant *this year* (which seems possible) and need Boggs to do it, I think they're making the same sort of mistake with Davis that Boston made with Boggs, leaving him in the minors for two or three years after he'd shown that he was a good hitter.  3.  Spike Owen.     See Wade Boggs.  I'd much rather see them develop Dave Silvestri     or whoever.  Wade and Spike next to each other in the infield is     going to raise the Yankee staff ERA 1/2 point.  And these guys     are on the down sides of their careers. Too bad they gave up on Randy Valarde.  Too many trips on the Columbus Shuttle!  Hrm? They still have him on the roster (16 AB through the first two weeks). They've just never figured out what to do with him. I suspect that he hits enough (especially vs. lefties) to be a reasonable shortstop. One rumor running around during spring training was that they wanted to convert Silvestri to be a catcher(!) because ""his body type was wrong for a shortstop"".

Yah.  So? Damn, Morris now has three and probably the Hall of Fame in his  future. He certainly didn't earn his last one.  *HOW* many games did he blow in the World Series?  All of the ones he started? He certainly did earn it!  He was a valuable member of the Blue Jay team.   Not particularly *in* the World Series. During the season, he was probably more valuable than, say, putting Olerud out there to pitch, but yeah, he *was* valuable in getting them there. In the postseason, he sucked dirty canal water through a straw. The Jays won *in spite* of Morris much more than *because of* him.  Therefore, I would have to say Toronto easily made the best signing. Oh, yes.  Definitely.  Therefore Morris is better than Clemens. Your definition of ""better"" refers to some measurement on a scale that has nothing to do with winning WS rings.  Umm, Roger? Return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago, where the poster Valentine was replying to used # of WS rings as a measure of better. The concept is called ""context"", and you should really become familiar with it someday.  The facts are that Morris has shown us that he has what it takes to play on a WS winning club. Clemens hasn't.  Unless this transaltes to ""Clemens hasn't gone into Lou Gorman's office with a large caliber handgun and refused to come out until he'd been traded to the Jays,"" I'm at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it.  You can go on about what Clemens has done in the  past and claim that he is ""better"" than Morris if you want to.  But  the facts are that Morris has shown us that he can win and Clemens hasn't.  What on earth does this mean? Over their careers, Clemens has ""won"" 68% of the games he's started, Morris 58%. Per year, Clemens has averaged nearly 17 wins, Morris just under 15. Would you grant the proposition that preventing the other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game? If so, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs/9 innings pitched. Morris allows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never in his career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens' career ERA. But I forget, in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance to Buckner missing that grounder in 1986  had Morris been on the Sox, it would have been a routine groundout, right?  Whether or not Clemens is better by your standard of measurement is totally meaningless.  The object of the game is not to compile  high figures in statistics that you have chosen to feel are important. The object of the game is to contribute to WS victories.  But this has been patiently explained to you many, many times and you are  either too stupid or too stubborn to grasp it.  Speaking of stupid, it has been patiently (and not-so-patiently) explained to you many times that attributing greatness to players based on the accomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that a racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race. Your continued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to any of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have spent a few too many games in goal without a mask.  Don't give me that shit.  If Boston had Alomar, Olerud, Henke, and Ward while Toronto had Rivera, Jack Clark, Jeff Reardon, things would have looked a little different last fall.  Give credit where credit is due.  This lavishing of praise on Morris makes me sick. Yes and the dog would have caught the rabbit too...forget about what didn't happen and open your eyes, for once, and look out there and see what is REALLY happening.  Forget about how Morris ""shouldn't"" have won 21 with an ERA over 4.   When Morris pitched, last year, the Jays won.  Stop crying about it and get on with life.  No one is crying  the Jays won, and as a team they certainly deserved to win at least the AL East. They performed well in two short series and won the World Series, and I congratulate them for it. As a Red Sox fan, I hope they keep Morris. I was happy when they picked up Stewart, and elated when they traded for Darrin Jackson. You see, unless you believe in some mystical link between Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man was credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. Luck runs out, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992, gave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16.  Seriously, Roger, I'd really like to hear your explanation of the difference between the 1982 Morris and the 1992 Morris. Which one was a better pitcher, and why? Did Morris somehow ""learn how to win"" in the intervening ten years? If so, then why did he go 18-12 in 1991 with Minnesota with an ERA over half a run lower than 1992?

After the employees leave the workplace, it doesn't matter what they say about the boss or the company?  Puhlease.   Strawberry's demeanor as represented by the media, often sounds like demands.  I suspect that a comment like ""I enjoy hitting fourth  I'm used to it"" would get pretty brutally misinterpreted by the media if it came from Strawberry.  Russ Porter quoted Strawberry as saying, ""I feel more comfortable hitting cleanup and I think I perform best in that role.""  (Paraphrased by my memory and bias.)  That seems like a fairly non-petulant answer to what was almost certainly a question  like, ""How do you feel about being moved to the third spot in the order?""   First, it's Ross Porter.  Second, I am really tired of seeing the kind of response that indicates that all I do is parrot what some media person says or writes.  I have a brain.  If I choose to characterize something in a certain fashion, it's because that is what I believe to be accurate.  It is not just because some unnamed ""mediot"" made the characterization.    A more media-sensitive player might answer ""The manager knows what he is doing.  If he thinks that batting me third will help the team, then I am all for it.""  We'd ignore that answer as brown stuff, so it seems a little bit of an overreaction to brand Darryl's response as petulant.  I did *not* brand Darryl's response as petulant, because I never heard any response from Darryl.  I did call him a name.  I referred to him  as a primadonna.  Someone else concluded that I did that because I ""hate"" him.  I don't hate him.  I think he's a primadonna.  If you disagree, fine.  But stop putting words in my mouth.    --	The Beastmaster     --  Mark Singer     mss@netcom.com"

Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody giving  Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards, marginal.  Honestly, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there. They're both  shortstops that just hung around for a long time. Big deal.       Let's be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors so  liberally. Save them for the guys who really deserve it. Face it, if something  isn't done, there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore. When  certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential  candidates, the absurdity is apparent. Gee, can these guys even compare to  the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan?    Q Steve  	What's the difference between Nolan Ryan and Yount?  Both have hung around for years, and continue to post great stats.  Why shouldn't Dave Kingman get into the Hall?  Or Murray, Evens, Reardon, and others?  What the hell do you have to do?

She has won an Emmy for research on Moe Berg for a TV documentary (which I know from nothing but which sounds good).  She said that among other things, Berg was the  principal spy for the OSS (CIA's WWII precursor) spying on Axis atomic programs, because of his physics background and language skills.  She said that during the war he met with Heisenberg in Switzerland, and had  instructions to shoot Heisenberg if the Germans were close to us in bomb research (he concluded they were two years behind, and didn't shoot him). (I have heard elsewhere that Heisenberg deliberately misled the Nazi bomb program, but I don't know how reliable this is.)  Unfortunately, NPR didn't mention any kind of a book she's writing -- I'd certainly buy it. Dave MB  There is a great book out called ""They Also Served"" which is about the  ballplayers during WWII.  There is some info on Berg in there.  It also has  info on Pete Gray (one armed outfielder) and other players of the era.  Because of the draft many players during the war were those who were exempt from the draft for medical reasons.  There are some very interesting stories in the book. It is very well written and I would suggest reading it to anyone with an  interest in baseball.

As soon as the ball was hit that far, his first instinct should be to root for Darryl to catch it, not to try to catch it himself, particularly when he is sitting that close.  I enjoy the attitude of the Wrigley fans, where they are against  visiting team home runs so much, they actually throw them back on the field.

Now that the fan has Mike Lupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the  big name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance He did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he  had Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.     Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent: Morning show:   In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi,  and Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morganti had a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP tries to copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms of sports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he interjects humor and politics into his show. 10 AM to 12 Noon:   I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their abilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the advantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller who is asking about who the local team is going to draft in the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get better interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that they were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless it was a major story.   I would consider this even because they are two different styles of host.  12 Noon to 2 PM:   At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to  Jody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been on for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability to transcend the ""homer"" mentality of the Philadelphia fan base.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia  spelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan. Where else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0 score without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning 'guys') I do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight and I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating hosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on  either station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and you can't get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.  2PM to 4PM:   This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and  Russo(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided in my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining, but they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10 to 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do get great guests and that is the basis for their show, so it is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the appearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which are often hilarious.    4 PM to 7 PM:   MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like Mike Missanelli but I just can't stomach Steve Fredericks.   I know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he was at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly homer now.  I don't listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there is a game on that night, but you will see later for the  reason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.  7 PM to Midnight:   S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes Eli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on charges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on my nerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go nuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show) On FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, Mets Jets, or St. John's basketball.  If the game is on the west coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of course I think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, but WIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season. (If this is the sports station, why did they lose the IGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.)) During the summer, it is all talk on WIP.   Overall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, with the exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and 12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.

Good players come up young  most players who come up young will be good.  This has always been the rule.   Are most players who come up young always good when they're young, or later?  Worse: it's not a ""shift"".  This is the way it has *always* been.  Several detailed studies of this have been done, and they've all shown that players aren't coming up any younger or older than in the past, and they aren't  playing any more or less in the minors than they used to.  The only thing that shifts is our memories of the ""good old days"" :-).  Damn.  I was afraid you would say that!   But all after the fact, which makes it *not* applicable to the current discussion, which is about how you decide whether to play the rookie who hasn't ""established himself"" in the majors over the mediocre veteran.  The Padres played Santiago that year because they clearly had nobody else worth playing.    Well, perhaps if the Braves had no one else worth playing this year it would be Lopez in there.  But they do have others worth playing, at least in *their* opinion.  And I happen to agree.   Both of these young men were highly touted defensive catchers, expected to be among the best ever in baseball.    Not by rec.sport.baseball consensus.  That may sound like an incredibly arrogant comment, but I've found that the SDCN consensus (when one exists) is right far more often than the media consensus or the opinions of ""baseball people"" affiliated with MLB.    I can believe that.  I'm a newbie here, so I'll take your word.  But Alomar *is* a fine defensive catcher, which was my statement above. That is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age, as long as they feel he can also hit a bit.  Lopez does not have such a consensus about his defensive prowess, and imho that is enough to give him that dreaded ""seasoning"".   I don't know ""who knows"".  I suppose the same people (or similar) who ""know"" he will be better than some other catcher.  These are, of  course, just differing opinions.  I read that his arm is not that strong (I suppose somewhere there is some measurement of SB ratios) and that he is still learning to call a game.  That latter skill may be difficult to project on someone without an intimate knowledge of his performance, but it is a tangible skill.  I disagree, in that I don't think it *is* a _tangible_ skill, any more than leadership is.  I don't deny that it is a *real* skill, and that some catchers may be much better than others at it, but I really don't see any way that we could ever know who they are.  Nichols's Law of Catcher Defense is eerily accurate far too often for me to take defensive assessments of catchers very seriously.  Sorry.  New.  Don't know Nichols' Law.  Don't believe in catchers' era.  But I am interested in pitchers' eras with different catchers. Any info on that?    Absolutely.  The evidence is piling up, year after year.  The only other alternative is that the Braves really don't *know* that their young players are, on average, better than their current starters.  I'm not ruling out that kind of gross incompetence, but I think the salary-schedule explanation is more charitable.  In other words, we know more than they do, so the only logic behind  a different decision than we would make must be financial.  I presume we feel this way about other franchises than Atlanta, no?   Consider: we *know* that the Braves are about the strongest team in baseball right now, even with Olson and Lemke and Nixon and Bream in the lineup.  They have as good a chance of repeating as champs this year as any team ever has. It actually makes some sense to say ""rather than making our team marginally better this year by bringing up the young studs and dumping the elderly, let's go ahead and compete this year with what we have, and then bring up the studs only as we *have* to, so that we'll still have them under reserve three years from now and beyond when the current team will be collecting pensions.""  Is it fair to the young players?  No.  Does it make organizational sense?  I think it does.  Well if it does make organizational sense, one can hardly fault them for their decisions.  I mean, please don't tell me how to run my business.  Especially when I'm being successful.    C:	I could make it 107 or 108 wins if you let me bring up Lopez.  S:	Listen, Bobby.  I'd like to.  But the way I see it, if he hits 	the big club this year we'll be paying mega-arbitration bucks 	down the road in a couple of years and there's no way I want 	to do that.  ...and continues with  	We can win without him, and then _keep_ winning next year with him. 	How's that?  I'm sure you could be right.  You could also be smoking some illegal substance.  (Hey.  That's a joke.  Don't get offended.  Please.)   Hey, I'd love to be wrong about this.  If you think it's unlikely, I'd love to know why.  Don't cite anybody's innate ethical rectitude, though, unless you know them personally.   Well, I can't cite anyone's ethical rectitude because I don't know what it means.  :)  But again, if it makes organizational sense, then so be it.  Baseball is a business, and if there is a solid business reason for keeping Lopez on the farm then that's what the Braves *should* do.  I happen to believe that it's a baseball decision.  While you from your armchair may disagee, I don't.  I think there is a lot of evidence to suggest the decision they made.  I predicted it among large guffaws from several at the start of spring training.  I think it is a very *normal* decision to have made.  It is certainly more reversible than to have started Lopez in the bigs and have released one of their catchers.  Sure, it may be conservative.  It may also be logical.  I don't know what ethics have to do with it. Seems like pretty good common sense to me.  --	The Beastmaster   --  Mark Singer     mss@netcom.com"

Some thoughts and facts,  1.)  Bill James is a partial owner of STATS, inc.  However he has almost nothing to do with the day-to-day operations of the company, although he does have significant input into the design of the books that bear his name. (The handbook, but not the scoreboard).  To the best of my knowledge, the only things that Bill actually writes for STATS are the predictions section of the handbook, and the Bill James Fantasy Baseball rulebook.  2.) The debate over Elias goes way back.  Bill James' early stuff was hampered by the fact that Elias would not give access to their stats at any price. Project Scoresheet, and later, STATS were founded to fill this void.  You can call STATS, and ask them for a report on just about anything in their database, and they will provide it -- for a price, of course.  Or you could just log into their online system and look at the data yourself.  Having attempted to pry numbers from Elias in the past (football, not baseball), they just don't do that.  In STATS eyes, the high ground comes from making the information available at all.  3.)  That being said, I'm pretty dissapointed by Bill's book this year, too. I am given to understant that it was mostly a response to the publishers  desire to have the book come out sooner than April.  Hope this makes things just a little bit clearer.  (Bias alert.

There is only one way of determin- ing ""best"" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at the  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best that day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the most  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the best of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro- cess  used to determine the ""best"" is the score of the game and it re- lates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.  And you know what?  There is no such method inherent in real life either.  So I would assume you would endorse the notion that we  cannot state, with any level of objectivity, that Mother Theresa has accomplished more good in this world than Joseph Stalin. After all, life on earth is a team effort.  If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has done  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But you have  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the individual's  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the only measure of ""best"" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base- ball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham- pionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub- jective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can predict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.  Have you tried glasses?  I find them quite useful.    After all, there must be some reason you choose to ignore the mounds of evidence we present.  It's too bad you feel it necessary to close your mind and eyes to knowledge  you live a poorer life as a result of that choice.  Heck, I'd wager that you could predict a WS winner with greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.  And you know why?  Because I have full confidence that despite your protestations to the contrary, you are quite capable of using the knowledge we can come up with through statistical methods to boost your knowledge level.     You don't have to be rude.  Have you tried calling a kettle black?  For you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point of  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio Elenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because he   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimed that in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an individual's  performance   from that of his team's for the purpose of comparing that individual's performance with another individual's per- formance.  In other words, in your world, you cannot objectively state that Jack Morris was more important to the Blue Jays than Al Leiter last year.  In your world, that may indeed be true.

Just a few lines about my favorite team sweeping the Dodgers (one of  my least favorite) in LA (Sweet!).  Also the Mets (my other least  favorite team) loss to the Rockies made this this a great day and a  great start to the weekend as the Cardinals are on the ESPN tonight.  Big Lee Smith is having a great start and the Cardinals seem to be hitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots of hits and not many runs.  Hopefully with the coaches stress on situational hitting in spring training, the runners LOB will be lower this year (probably due to the high strikeout numbers by Jose and Lankford and Zeile's off year).  I don't know why all the fuss about the Fillies.  The media and all the  Filly fans on r.s.b forget who is right behind them in the standings.   Give the Wild Thing a week or two before he starts blowing some games  and we'll see who is in first then.  I believe the Cardinal pitching  staff is more complete than the Filly staff and that will make the difference.  On a side note, a few years ago (5-6), a comment was made by some  baseball player or manager about the Dodger defense.  He was asked  where to hit the ball against the Dodgers and he replied ""Fair.""  I  remember it being in the ""They Said It"" section of Sports Illustrated. I would like to know who said it and what issue it was in.  GO REDBIRDS!!  Gary Wieman"

rec_sport_baseball;"From: choman@rajeesh.WPI.EDU (Charles Stanley Homan) Subject: RBI Question  Is there any judgement call on the part of the scorer for sac fly RBI's? This is the situation that brought the question up:  The Red Sox were up in the bottom of the 9th by a score of 5-1.  The Mariners had the bases loaded with 1 out.  The batter hits a fly to center, which the fielder catches.  The runner at third tags and scores without a throw.    Now, without a judgement call (and I don't think there is one), this is an RBI for the batter.  It seems to me that a better name for this would be ""defensive indifference"", since it doesn't really matter whether the guy at third scores at that point.  (I know, I can think of several ""If the Mariners stole third and second, which opening the base would allow, and then the batter hit a grounder which the third baseman gets deep in the hole between himself and third, he wouldn't have a play at home, third, or second for the out, and maybe he therefore can't make the throw to first to get the last out, etc... scenarios, too.  But does it _really_ matter if this guy scores this way when you're down by 4?  If the tying run is going to score, so is the guy on third.)  The point is that the batter (IMO) shouldn't get ""credit"" (an RBI) for utterly failing to do his job - which at this point is to get a hit or a walk, not trade an out for one run.

His equivalent  average started at .253 in 88, was up to .274 in 89 and 286 in 90. So  let us say he had established, in his last two seasons, a .280 level  of play.  I'm not quite sure how these numbers are generated.  It appears that in a neutral park Bo's HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two home runs).  Or do they?  What is ""equivalent average?""  One thing, when looking at Bo's stats, is that you can see that KC took away some homers.  Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for doubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you expect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  But Bo, despite his speed,  hit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect his value to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.     That is good. Very good, in fact. But it probably doesn't make the top  ten in the league. The 10th best EQA in the AL in 1992 was Dave  Winfield's .296  Thomas was first at .350. First in the NL was Bonds,  an incroyable .378  tenth was Bip Roberts, .297. But .280 is better  than any season in the past five years by Joe Carter  it is about what  Mattingly had in 1988 (.285)  what Felix Jose had the last two years   just ahead of Time Raines' five-year average  better than Ryan  Klesko's MLEs.   Felix Jose has been a .350/.440 player in a fairly neutral park. I would offhand guess the `89-`90 Bo at around a .330/.530 player. Maybe .330/.550 .  Not even close.   He got more attention from the media than was warranted from his  baseball playing, though  his hype was a lot better than his hitting.  That is the basis for the net.comments about him being overrated. The  media would have you beleive he was a great hitter. I think he was a  good, maybe very good hitter. He was IMO, something like the 30th best  hitter in the majors.  I'd put him about there too.    Note: I hadn't realized the media had hyped him so much.  I thought he was always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so  at baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn't winning.  Note 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a mistake being made (by the SDCN's, as they are known, on this group) with respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).  We find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major and minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well. Their are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction  the lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent the player has left college ball, etc.  Now of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of ""error.""  Sometimes a player with poor MLE's (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star. Some hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don't (Oddibe McDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are real reasons why Oddibe didn't hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows) involve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting and so on.  But still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well. One of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background of the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is that all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing ball.  Their backgrounds are similar.  What hasn't been established is what happens when you encounter a player with a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a Bo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so on, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard assumptions fit this person slowly?  It hasn't been established that you can use MLE's with two-sport players. (It hasn't been established that you can't, but then statistics is, after all, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually make completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton. ""Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,"" they say.  Well, what happens if those numbers simply don't mean what they usually mean? It might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than Tuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in Atlanta than Greenville.    Then again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank this year, live up to those poor MLE's.  But you guys DON'T KNOW.  What's  worse, you don't know that you don't.  And you don't know that there are  other players you won't know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties  again.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.  It's not. It's got some error.  Oh well.  Bill Guilford  still thinks ""hairy butt is truly ugly"" might be right"

rec_sport_baseball;"From: fierkelab@bchm.biochem.duke.edu (Eric Roush) Subject: Re: Young Catchers  Since I was the one responsible for these divergent threads of approx. 40+ posts (going back to: The Braves could be better off if an injury happens), I may as well inject a little more fuel to the flame!  1)  Back at the beginning of Spring Training, I though Lopez would make the squad easily.  Olson was still recovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe), and there were questions as to whether he would be able to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.  I was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez can hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was the Braves ""Defensive Catcher"" prospect, while Brian Deak was the Braves ""Offensive Catcher"" prospect.  Besides, Olson and Berryhill couldn't hit their way out of a wet cardboard box, and don't walk enough to be useful.  But Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went with the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down at the start of the season, he wouldn't have gotten his job back.  2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around. After all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and tear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher (California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to move Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work. Plus, you'd have to eat that salary, which isn't huge, but isn't tiddleywinks either (I think Olson's at about $800,000, Berryhill at $450,000, but that's only what I recall).  3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to play in this also.  What is it, that 5/6 of the 2+year players aren't eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1/6 that were on the roster the longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change, but the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business standpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June/the first time Olson/Berryhill go on the DL.  4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn't on the team. I still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves, and the truth is that I'd rather see our best team on the field, which, IMO, includes Lopez.  Of course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won't need him.  )  As for the Schuerholz/Cox conversation, I imagine it went like this:  (Remember, they've BOTH been GM's) (the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)  Cox:  OK, we've sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a little smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding is better than it used to be.  Schuerholz:  Well, we'll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion just won't sign that baseball only contract.  We can't count on him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the defense.  Besides, Gorman's not ready to give up on Billy Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher's gone AND Deion signs, we can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to give us some pitching depth in 1995.  Cox:  Yep, that'll be nice.  Too bad Deion won't sign. OK, I'll look for Nieves when Justice starts having Berry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about Klesko?  Schuerholz:  Well, we've still got to fork out another 1.5 mil for Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money or Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell, but somehow he doesn't seem to be the same GM.  First Jeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he gets rid of Brian Jordan, then I'd HAVE to believe that he and Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!  Cox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I'll wait til the trading deadline for my Hunter/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few extra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California... if Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid. And if that doesn't work, then perhaps Sid's knees could be ""persuaded"" to act up.  There's always the 15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!  Schuerholz:  What about Caraballo?  Cox:  Well, he's not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts in Richmond, he'll start walking more.  Besides, if he's going to be arbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually get some value from him before he makes the big bucks.  Schuerholz:  Now, let's see.  That leaves Lopez.  Cox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn't think Olson would recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into running into him again?  Schuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he'll get $3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one extra year.  Besides, until Olson's shown his stuff a little bit, I can't trade him.  Besides, Berryhill's a left-handed hitter.  You know how rare that is?  Cox:  Don't you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common, if you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in the World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!  Schuerholz:  Hey, you're the one who wouldn't write Lopez into the lineup.  Cox:  Well, you're the one who went out and got me Jeff Reardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn't be used to our pitching staff's stuff.  He got some time with them this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?  Schuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep will be hurt by May.  Cox:  OK, OK, you made your point.  Keep them both.  Surely one of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then I can call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games!  The Pennant! THE WORLD SERIES!  I'll be up there with John McGraw!  Casey Stengel!  Earl Weaver!  Oh, they laughed at me in Toronto, but have you ever had to deal with George Bell?  I'll finally get my just reward!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha!  Schuerholz:  Easy, Bobby.

Well, we agree on the last part.:-)   Cool.  And thank you for an intelligent response devoid of the silly name-calling of others.  :)    One of the basic things you need to  have in a statistic to be able to predict a player's performance on it in the future is for there to be a correlation from year to year.  A  player's batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year.  OK.  the basic problems with something like ""clutch"" batting average - overall batting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero.  Adding to the sample size doesn't seem to help much.  Actually, I think the large-scale sample size is part of the problem. It seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball in regard to BA vs. Clutch BA deviation we would get some kind of bell curve.  (The X-axis being the +/- deviation in clutch hitting vs. non-clutch   the Y-axis being the number of players.)  Certainly there would be *some* players on the extreme ends of the bell.  My *supposition* is that if we were to find the SAME players consistently (year after year) at one end of the bell or the other, then we might be able to make some reasonable conclusions about *those* players (as opposed to all baseball players).    As a counterexample to  what you showed, consider the following two players from 1984-1987:                 Non-Clutch                      Clutch                AB      H       BA              AB      H       BA   Maldonado      1060    260     .245            254     78      .307 Lemon          1643    457     .278            256     57      .223  If you had had these two players in 1988, by your logic, in those ""clutch"" situations, you'd bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye.  Well, in  1988, Maldonado hit .267 in ""non-clutch"" and .190 in ""clutch"", while Lemon hit .254 in ""non-clutch"" and .313 in ""clutch"".  Before you accuse me of  completely cooking the data,  You won't hear those kind of accusations from me.  It is interesting that you selected Maldonado, because he is someone whom I have also  looked at.  He has been a very inconsistent hitter (in terms of BA), hitting in 1989 - 92  .217, .273, .250, .272    Admittedly, he has been traded between leagues as well as clubs.  His clutch hitting  record is equally inconsistent.  So, for my purposes in 1993 I would not draw any conclusions about his ability to hit in the clutch based on his prior performance.  I don't know how I would have felt in 1988, but you may indeed be right.    When I looked at Sabo I found a more consistent record of hitting, and a more consistent pattern of his clutch hitting being proportionately below his non-clutch BA.  Ditto for Joe Carter.  This probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having with others on this topic.  Must any conclusion based on statistical history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before it has any validity?  Is it impossible (or irrational) to apply statistical analysis to selected components of the data base?   BTW, correlating players' _overall_ batting average from '84-'87 with '88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59, which is significant at something better than the 99.9% confidence level.  Correlating their (clutch-non-clutch BA) for the same period gives a correlation of  0.088, significant at no level of any interest.  I completely accept that reasoning.  Again, what if we were to find the same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent basis?   Actually, it's technically incorrect to say that we can't predict future clutch performance.  It's more correct to say that we can't predict future clutch performance with any skill.  amen.    --	The Beastmaster   --  Mark Singer     mss@netcom.com"

I just don't understand how some athlete, who only plays a sport   for a   living for millions of dollars, say he is not being paid enough.    If nobody will sign him for his asking price, he will be the one   hurting.  The A's will still win without him.  Will they?  You can't usually take away one of the team's best players and still expect them to win.  Or do you think the  Pirates will continue to win without Barry Bonds.     Remeber, many of these athletes have NOTHING if not for their   athletic   ability.  NOTHING.  They are getting paid MUCH more than most hard   working  citizens, and they are complaining of not enough pay.  So. Again, Jack Nicholson gets paid much more than most hard working citizens (and much more than Rickey Henderson for that matter).      I don't have a problem with them making millions.  My problem is   when the  say they aren't being paid enough, when they already get 3   million--also,  their numbers get worse.  The reason the latter often happens is that many of these folks start making the real big salaries late in their career, when they are on the decline. (There are exceptions, of course.

I read once that the Babe made $80,000 one year and that was about as good  as it got for him.  Let's assume he made that in 1928 (I'm not sure of the figures, but I know I'm in the ballpark--pun intended). :-)  Today, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if not accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth.  FV = $80,000 x (1+4%)(1993-1928)    = $80,000 x (1.04)65    = just over $1,000,000.  Assuming inflation is average of around 5%.  FV = $80,000 x (1+5%)65    = almost 2,000,000.  (I didn't crunch these numbers beforehand).  These numbers might lead one to believe that today's players are slightly  overpaid.  The Babe appears to have made then what today's average to above average players make now.  Perfectly accurate salary, year of salary, and  average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate, but I don`t  think I'm off by much.

I think it's just 12 games into the season myself, so I'm going to wait a bit before calling names.  2) I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an impressive win last week. Now Otto's latest debacle has restored Simmons' reputation. Now he looks like he is back in his '92 form when he had the AL's highest ERA among starters. Four our sake(not Ted's sake), I hope he pitches with a 3.5 ERA for the rest of the season. Yeah, right.  I expect that Dave Otto will be a really bad pitcher, and I have no idea why Simmons ever wanted him.  On the other hand, I expect him to release Otto if he doesn't turn things around pretty fast.  (BTW, Otto's game score for that 0 IP stinker was only 22, which points out a problem with the method since Otto's performance was infinitely bad, and excruciatingly prolonged.)  3) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing. They are still doing decently. But considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have shown their first seasons, they seem to have actually gotten a little bit worse.   I think Merced's rookie year was a bit flukey, but aren't you willing to give him some more at bats (and Tomlin a few more starts) before acting so gloomy?  4) Walk: Well, he seems to be on the losing end tonight. BUt I still think  that Walk desrved his contract.  No he didn't.  Walk is a time bomb.  He has no stuff whatsoever, and when the league finally realizes this, it won't be pretty at all.  8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn't been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.  Don't be so fast.  Doughty is the guy who signed Steve Buechele, which was a move that threatened to bury Kevin Young in the minors. Meanwhile, I'm not sure whether Doughty or Simmons signed Martin as a six-year free agent before the 1992 season.  9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke.  Twice through the rotation, and you've given up?  Yikes.  10) Slaught: How come he wasn't given a contract extension last year?  Now his value has increased immensely.  But so has his age, at least in baseball terms.  The useful half-life of a 34- year-old injury-prone catcher can't be much longer than a year.  11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount.  But he wanted to be a Dodger, and felt he had something to prove after his disastrous 1992.  I don't think there was any chance for the Bucs to sign him.  Let's see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better. Now why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better than a healthy Lonnie Smith.   He certainly wasn't last year.  Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won't be an asset.  He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.  Hey, that's the ""Skates Smith"" package deal.  Anybody who acquires Lonnie for his defense or base-running (particularly at this stage) is a real weirdo.  12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful argument in favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that idiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay.  If that's the goal of the team ownership, than I don't see why Sauer gets a zero for making his boss happy.  I don't know what he has or hasn't said about revenue sharing, so I can't comment there.  13) Alex Cole fiasco.   [stuff deleted] Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmons' tenure was getting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad. [that he gave him away in the expansion draft.]  It's annoying, but since Leyland seems to have been pushing for them to retain Jeff King, it was probably unavoidable.  Meanwhile, I think bigger accomplishments of Simmons' tenure were getting some value for John Smiley, not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch last year, drafting well in 1992, letting the rookies show something in 1993.  Foley, Smith, and Candelaria were acquired to be replacement parts, which means that even if fail it hasn't done serious damage to the Bucs' future.  14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant  and rave. they will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still  being appealed.  Does this mean that the Bucs lost the initial arbitration case?  I never heard the outcome of this.  When will the final verdict be in on this?  Now, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots, nothing else will.  I'm not sure who was the idiot in this case, so I don't know who to blame.  It might have been Doug Danforth, after all.  In fact, I *seriously* suspect it was Doug Danforth, who has shown his willingness to call the shots at exactly those moments when the gun is pointed at his feet.

The sooner you get him acclimated, the more of his prime you get to use.  Can anybody name a player who was 'rushed' to the majors (let's, for argument's sake, define ""rushed"" as brought up to the majors for more than a cup of coffee prior at age 22 or younger, and performing below expectations), whose career was damaged by this rushing?  I'm serious  I tend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better, but I'd like to look at players for whom this theory didn't work, if there are any.  I'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I can look up their minor league stats.  (It's important to distinguish between players who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers would have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, but actually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers).    Let's kick it off with an example of a player who was ""rushed"", although there doesn't seem to have been any damage to his career.  Jay Bell was given 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below what you would expect from his AAA numbers the same season.  He got 236 PAs the next year at age 22, and still underperformed.  However, the next year, at age 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job, and has been there ever since.  It's really hard for me to see where he would have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was performed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being ""rushed""  Cleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might have been less likely to give up on him.  Yes, if you bring a player up early, he's likely going to struggle.  But does that delay the time at which he stops struggling, and starts performing up to expectations?

Tate) Subject: Re: Young Catchers  mss@netcom.com (Mark Singer) said:  We know that very, very few players at this age make much of an impact in the bigs, especially when they haven't even played AAA ball.    Yes.  But this is *irrelevant*.  You're talking about averages, when we have lots of information about THIS PLAYER IN PARTICULAR to base our decisions on.  I might as well say ""We know that very, very few people are more than 7 feet tall, so chances are that Manute Bol is really only 6 foot 4.""  No.  Maybe I need to improve my writing skills.  Lopez, who is very ordinary defensively, is not likely to hit so well at age 22 (having not played at AAA level) that it is probably not a good idea to rush him into the Braves lineup in 1993.  Why isn't Lopez likely to hit that well?  He hit that well last year (after adjusting his stats for park and league and such)  he hit better (on an absolute scale) than Olson or Berryhill did.  By a lot.  As for rushing...  If there really is a qualitative difference between the minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment (and I don't believe there is), then wouldn't you rather waste Lopez's 22-year old good season than his 23-year old very good season or his 24-year-old excellent season?  The sooner you get him acclimated, the more of his prime you get to use.  Lopez was hitting .588 over 17 AB when he was cut from spring training.  What does he have to do to earn a chance?  Maybe not a full time job, but at least a couple starts and a few AB for him to prove his worth?  Gee.  I don't know.  17 abs sounds pretty good to me!  About as good as your reasoning that the kid should play a back-up role rather than start every day at AAA.  Talk about *me* as a GM...  The point was not that 17 AB is a significant sample, but rather that he hadn't done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager to question whether his minor league numbers were for real, or to send him down ""until he gets warmed up"".  OK.  Most players are not ready for the bigs at age 22   Most players are *never* ready for the bigs.  What does this have to do with Javy Lopez?  Most players  benefit, rather than being stagnant or hurt, by playing at AAA.  See above.    Most catchers need to be solid defensively players to help their clubs in the bigs.  Those are the arguments against Lopez for the Braves for this year.  But I could apply the same reasoning to Frank Thomas or Barry Bonds.  Most players aren't that good, so they probably won't be that good this year either.  Now.  The Braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid abilities to call games, to work with the pitchers, to throw out runners.    And demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble.  Not superstars mind you, but solid, experienced veterans.  Not superstars, not stars, not even good players.  Maybe average, if we're being charitable.  The Braves have a very solid lineup with two big bats in the outfield, an excellent platoon at first, a solid MVP candidate at third and one of the better hitting shortstops.    Ummm.  Justice is a very fine hitter.  Pendleton might have another big year in his bat, but he might also spend the season in Hamstring Hell.  Gant is a big question mark.  The Bream/Hunter platoon is decent (not excellent) and has rotten OBP or SLG (depending on who's in).  Blauser is a very valuable bat... for a shortstop.   The center field platoon will probably hit .300.  However good Lopez' bat *might* be (given the above) it won't be so much better than what they have to offset the differential in experience and  defensive ability.    Wanna bet?  The difference between Lopez's bat and Olson/Berryhill could be 20 or 30 runs over the course of the season.  Given a choice between a player with experience and a player who can play, I'll take the latter every time.  The kid *will* improve playing at AAA,   Just like Keith Mitchell did?  I am just so surprised I have to spell all of this out.  My  goodness.  Do you believe the other poster who thinks Lopez is being held down because of his future earning potential?  That was me, and you so far your only counter-proposal is that they really don't understand how good Lopez is, or overvalue experience, or some combination of the two.  I think my interpretation was more flattering to the organization.  Are they idiots who have built this ballclub?    [Well-argued but inflammatory reply deleted.]   --    David M.

""no such  thing as clutch hitting"" they (the SDCN's) all screamed.  I assumed  they also meant there was no such thing as any kind of clutch performance,  given their comments.    This is certainly not the case.  There is no significant *ability* toi perform in the clutch, but clutch performance certainly happens every time there is a game-winning hit.  The ""clutch pitching"" quoted above is something which happened, not a claim that any particular player should be expected to be a clutch pitcher.   Over the past four seasons Sabo has had 59 hits in 259 abs defined as  clutch situations (by The Scouting Report) for an average of .228.  Over that same period he had another 1539 abs with 452 hits for an  average of .294.   According to the rest of the SDCN's, any differential such as this is  completely and totally random and cannot be used for any reasonable  inference, such as perhaps Perez should have used a pinch hitter in  that situation.  Simple statistics tell me that there is a 2% chance an average clutch hitter would have this large a split (the average decrease is 7 points, standard deviation about 30).  There will be such hitters in any league, just as there will be hitters who hit poorly on Tuesdays.  And there is only a very weak correlation (.01 in my best study) between clutch hitting in the last four years and clutch hitting this year, probably because most of the clutch data is determinaed by luck rather than any ability.  *Based only on this data*, I don't see any reason to pinch-hit for Sabo, or any other player who had been a poor clutch hitter in the past.  But there are many other factors involved in a decision to pinch-hit. Does the pinch-hitter give you a platoon advantage?  (Any portion of Sabo's clutch split that results from his platoon split is certainly a real ability, even if it has nothing to do with clutch hitting.)

However, a fielder who plays shallow will catch more short flies and fewer long flies  this means that he will allow fewer singles but more doubles.  Has anyone seen these players' positioning?  Do Butler and Felix play deep, and Lankford, Martinez, and Wilson shallow, or is this a park effect?  I thought Butler liked to play shallow.  -- David Grabiner, grabiner@zariski.harvard.edu ""We are sorry, but the number you have dialed is imaginary.""

It seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball in regard to BA vs. Clutch BA deviation we would get some kind of bell curve.  (The X-axis being the +/- deviation in clutch hitting vs. non-clutch   the Y-axis being the number of players.)  Certainly there would be *some* players on the extreme ends of the bell.  My *supposition* is that if we were to find the SAME players consistently (year after year) at one end of the bell or the other, then we might be able to make some reasonable conclusions about *those* players (as opposed to all baseball players).  Let's be careful here.  If players' performance was completely random in (Clutch-No Clutch), then you would still expect some players to be good in the clutch every year and some to be not-so-good every year. With two years worth of data, you'd have 1/4 of the players good each year, 1/4 bad each year, and 1/2 would have one good and one bad year. We have 96 players for 5 years ('84-'88).  Just flipping a coin, you'd expect 3 players to be good all 5 years and 3 to be bad every year. This is what we actually get--  No. of good years    0    1    2    3    4    5 Clutch performers    4   10   37   24   18    3 Coin flip (random)   3   15   30   30   15    3  Essentially the distribution of clutch performers by number of years of good performance is the same as what you would get if the process leading to deviations from non-clutch performance was completely random. If there was anything to clutch hitting (at least in this definition) that had any predictive capability, you expect to see the number of players at the ends to be much larger than that predicted by flipping a coin.  Further, if you limit yourself to players who were a lot above or below average in clutch situations (say, 1 standard deviation from  the mean) more than one year, the random explanation still looks good. In the four years ('84-'87) that I looked at the data from Elias, there were 79 (29) players with a minimum of 25 (50) at bats in clutch  situations that were 1 sigma from the mean two different years.  Of those 79 (29) players, 38 (14) of them changed sign between the two years.  In other words, they were great clutch hitters one year and really horrible the other year.  If it was just a random process,  you'd expect those numbers to be 39.5 (14.5).    Everything that's been measured about clutch hitting over a period of years that could be used to predict any ability with any  proposed definition has looked like a random process (with the  caveat that there may be something related to platoon advantage that could be dragged out of the data--e.g., John Lowenstein  probably never had a ""clutch"" AB against a left-handed pitcher, but he might well have had some in blowouts, so that there would be a bias since his clutch ABs would be more geared to his  platoon advantage).  This is not a subject that has been glanced at casually.  A lot of people have put a lot of effort into  studying it and every one of them, with the exception of the Elias study, has been unable to find anything that would allow you to predict how someone will do in clutch situations better than flipping a coin.  (Self-serving plug follows:  some of the flaws in the Elias study are discussed in my paper in the forth- coming SABR book, _The Perfect Game_, by Taylor Publishing.

rec_sport_baseball;From: paul@csd4.csd.uwm.edu (Paul R Krueger) Subject: Brewer bullpen rocked again...  For the second straight game, California scored a ton of late runs to crush the Brewhas. It was six runs in the 8th for a 12-5 win Monday and five in the 8th and six in the 9th for a 12-2 win yesterday. Jamie Navarro pitched seven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part in the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How's this for numbers? Maldanado has pitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is 0.75. The next lowest on the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!  It doesn't look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, while Thon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The next best hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team's only HR, at .238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the team is 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/game and giving up 6.6/game.   Still, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense should come around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gave the Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo,  Fetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be successful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either held small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay, the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen is a big question mark.  In other news, Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday, while William Suero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal. Today's game with California was cancelled.  --salty

rec_sport_baseball;"From: steph@pegasus.cs.uiuc.edu (Dale Stephenson) Subject: Hits Stolen -- Second Base 1992  Disclaimer -- This is for fun.  In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called ""stolen hits"", defined as a play made that ""an average fielder would not make with average effort.""  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted by Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats for the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as ""Plays Kurt Stillwell would not have made.""  OK, I realize that's unfair.  Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff, fluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we replaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's 57.6% out making ability, how many extra hits would go by?  To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net Hits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Double Plays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).  Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or DCON :-.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player. I add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which should represent the player's total contribution to the team.  So don't take it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this article.  The short version -- definition of terms HS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell NHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder NDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder NEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder DCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.

Henderson is the best leadoff hitter of all-time, arguably. Winfield has   meant more to his team than Henderson. Unlike daryll, henderson tries   hard. He is an amazing centerfielder.

While we're on the multipurpose subject, let's not forget Shea, which was designed to accommodate both the Mets & Jets.  It was the first stadium (I think) to have the box seats on rollers so they could be oriented at right angles for baseball & in parallel for football.  Not the first.  RFK, olim DC Stadium, was built 2 years earlier. Nowadays they don't move the seats back for the few exhibition games  but the 3rd-base/LF lower deck used to move.  It was all  metal, which was pretty noisy on Bat Day.  Of course, with the Jets gone to Jersey (and a truly good football stadium), the Mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where, because it's circular, the seats are almost always too far from the action.  The Mets announcers--Kiner & Murphy in particular--have always hyped it as ""beautiful Shea Stadium,"" a tipoff to how unbeautiful it truly is.

As a long time Red Sox fan, I will simply say:  The Impossible Dream Year - 1967 for those of you with short memories. short lives, or both.

This statement is supported based on the increased number of 'Brave Woofers' out on the net.  A true fan of a  team, any team, will follow that team through the good years as well as the lean years, and be amply rewarded when the time is right.    Yeah, so what if Buckner let a roller go through his legs in `86.  Who cares if Clemens told Cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower.  The fact is, they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fans supported them.  Now that it appears that they are on lean times, the number of  detracters come from all over.  So what!  Let them play and we will see what  happens come September.  The Red Sox may not be that good, but they are certainly  not that bad, either and they do have a chance to win the World Series, after all, remember the `69 Mets?  Who would have given them a chance to even make it that far, let alone beat Baltimore.  Let's face it, Baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than Football and Basketball.

If you get someone qualified for the 60-day  that reduces the frequency of re-evaluations.  There is no longer, I  believe, any limit to the number of players you can place on the DL.

I have no first hand experience with her ability as an umpire.  But I have seen her on talk shows. And her point seems to be that she can call balls and strikes as well as any of the umpires and she knows the rulebook better than most. It seems to me that she is missing the point and if that's how she sees the role of umpires in the game, well I wouldn't promote her either.  The umpires primary role has nothing to do with calling baserunners safe or out  hell, Joe Lundy could do that. Their primary function is to maintain order in the game, keep the game moving, and keep the players from trying to kill each other.   Umpires have to be extremely tough people. That disqualifies most of us, both men and women. And if Ms. Postema thinks that she deserves to be a major league umpire because of her command of the rulebook, then I think that disqualifies her as well.

True, he was limited by injuries in his sophomore season, but his numbers both that yaer and the year following were quite mediocre.  This season the same Bill James projects a ba of .265, OPS of 675.    The same Bill James? Why do you say that? It sounds like you're suggesting  Bill James had something to do with overhyping the kid to death. Au contraire  he was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign, noting that he wasn't all-world as a catcher or a hitter. He called him basically average when everyone *else* in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy Campanella.   Both of these young men were highly touted defensive catchers, expected to be among the best ever in baseball.  The reports I read indicate that Lopez is very ordinary defensively.    Which reports are those?   The Dodgers options are Parrish and Hernandez, and now only Carlos. Piazza is 24.  As long as he continues with his *very* hot bat, they will keep him in the lineup because they need the offensive production.  When he cools off, look for the much better defensive catcher Hernandez (only 25) to play more.    I like Hernandez a lot, but if Piazza can catch the ball, you've gotta play him IMHO. He's a much better hitter, although Hernandez isn't a *bad* hitter. Right now, it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez will be Candiotti's caddy since he can catch the knuckler. As long as they play up to their abilities, the Dodgers could have a very good catching tandem.    The Braves options are Berryhill and Olson.  I agree that Olson is nothing special, but I do think Berryhill is better than many  people on rsb believe.  But both the Braves' catchers are very good defensively (calling a game, blocking the plate, throwing) and although they are somewhat weak offenivsively, they play on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat.    I think both are overrated defensively (see Nichols' Law of catcher defense), but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove from your viewpoint or mine. About the only tangible thing we can look at is opponent's SB%, and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners. Catchers ERA is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases.     As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves' armor is that they're weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliard plays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak  defensively if Blauser plays. I'd like to see the Braves give at least one of Mel Nieves, Javy Lopez or Chipper Jones a shot, but much like the talent-rich Jays of recent years they'll be conservative and stick with what they have.  I'm not saying that's wrong, just conservative.    --  Dave Hung Like a Jim Acker Slider Kirsch      Blue Jays - Do it again in '93  kirsch@staff.tc.umn.edu                        New .. quotes out of context!

Besides, Wade just doesn't have any range.  What a shame about     Charlie Hayes, huh? Who would you have playing 3B, Wade Boggs or Charlie Hayes?  My choice is Boggs.  No contest.  It will give them time to develop younger talent in an area the Yankee farm system seems to be deficient.    A-hem. Two words: Russell Davis. Playing in the cavern at Albany (AA) last  year (375/410/385 down the alleys and to center), Davis went .285/.355/.483  with 22 homers. There aren't any small parks on the road in the Eastern  League, either. He's 23(!) and his MLE was .258/.308/.416, 17 HR. I have no  fielding statistics, but from seeing him a number of times last year I'd say  that he's not Brooks Robinson, but neither is he Howard Johnson. Unless they  think they can win the pennant *this year* (which seems possible) and need  Boggs to do it, I think they're making the same sort of mistake with Davis  that Boston made with Boggs, leaving him in the minors for two or three  years after he'd shown that he was a good hitter.   3.  Spike Owen.     See Wade Boggs.  I'd much rather see them develop Dave Silvestri     or whoever.  Wade and Spike next to each other in the infield is     going to raise the Yankee staff ERA 1/2 point.  And these guys     are on the down sides of their careers. Too bad they gave up on Randy Valarde.  Too many trips on the Columbus Shuttle!    Hrm? They still have him on the roster (16 AB through the first two weeks).  They've just never figured out what to do with him. I suspect that he hits  enough (especially vs. lefties) to be a reasonable shortstop. One rumor  running around during spring training was that they wanted to convert  Silvestri to be a catcher(!) because ""his body type was wrong for a  shortstop"".

I was there to see them face Baltimore and couldn't help but listen to the Boston fans talk about various players on the team.  One guy was totally obliterating Boggs, how he sucks, etc....  I told him I was a Yankee fan and I'd take him in a second and who would he want in a trade back.  He said a pile of sh*t.  I know Boggs had some personal problems while playing for Boston, but come on he's a future hall of famer who really adds a needed dimension to the Yanks.  A solid hitter, a decent fielder and more importantly a teacher, ask Pat Kelly.  I think he's got a few good years left in his bat and may be a key contributor down the stretch as they win the American League East this year.  Boston fans have no class!!!

Well, it looks like, just as Doug trumped Tim, beating him to the net with his defensive analyses, so Tim has gotten in ahead of me.  The way I was doing it was a little different. Being me, of course, I used equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth, and I calculated both rate of performance (fielding equivalent average) and total performance (fielding equivalent runs). But I compared, not to the average player, but the replacement player, and here's why: because the positional adjustment comes built in to the system. In the AL of 1992, the average SS is 32.9 runs above replacement (RAR)  cf, 31.6  2B, 28.8  3B, 26.3  LF, 26.0  RF, 24.6  1B, 16.9. We may quibble with the exact numbers, but the order looks substantially right.  In the equivalent average, I have always set league average to .235. I had decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of .180  the name of that replacement level hitter, often as not, is ""Billy Ripken"". I decided to let the replacement level fielder be the same distance from .235 as .180, but in the opposite direction as I have set it up  that makes for an eqa of .280. (Yes, I can add. Runs are proportional to eqa squared  the difference between 180 squared and 235 squared equals the difference to 279 squared, and I rounded off for simplicity). An all-replacement fielding team would have: Randy Milligan at first (.282), Willie Randolph (.269) at second, Leo Gomez (.279) at third, Walt Weiss (.269) at short, Kevin Bass (.271) in left, HoJo (.257) in center, and Eric Anthony (.277) in right. Ugh.  So, the total number of RAR for a player is the sum of his batting and fielding RAR. I can rate them by total RAR, or RAR per some number of batting outs, like 400. An average player has a total RAR of about 55, 30 batting, 25 fielding.  Total RAR (bat/field)  1. Bonds      152 (124/28)  Ventura    124 (66/58) 2.

In article <C5JKIK.1zF@ucdavis.edu ez027993@dale.ucdavis.edu (Gary Built Like Villanueva Huckabay) writes: Here's my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep '92, and Jose Canseco, circa June 1986.  1.  He's bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,     not gain more bulk.  I've been saying that for at least 2 years now and even the A's conditioning guru told Jose he was carrying too much weight and losing some would help his back.Although I don't for one second believe Jose used steroids,his back problems are very similar to problems alot of steroid users experience because they are simply carrying too much weight on their frame(see Jeff Bregel ex 49er as a textbook example), and IMHO Jose is too big for his frame.   2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I'd say he's     lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed.  I can't imagine how to estimate bat speed, but its pretty obvious that Jose is missing fastballs he used to hit, likely due to his back.   3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like     Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is     released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -     Canseco can't.  Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his     stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,     they're fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it's hard     to make adjustments in your swing.  I don't know, he had an even more open stance when he first came up with the A's, and had no problems with it then. It might be that pre-back problems, he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance caused, but now he's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts him. The old saying if you're hot its a trigger mechanism, if you're cold, its a hitch.   First, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance, and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this will cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move the bathead more freely.  The biggest problem IMHO is he never has found a stance he's comfortable with for more than a few months. He changes his stance so much, he loses track of where the strike zone is. In Wednesday's night game, he was  clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to me. I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because he's changed his stance so much.  I'm also a bit concerned that because he's got Palmer and Gonzalez hitting all the homeruns, he'll become competitive, swing even harder and screw himself up even worse. LaRussa always said that Canseco's famous batting practice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouraged bad hitting habits.

And it all depends on the definition that you use for ""better"". Yours is based on what could have been and mine is based on what really happened.  Well, actually, most of ours is based on what really happened and yours is based on some fantasy of how it happened. But that's OK, I understand you have a hockey background. Stats like ""plus/minus"" make RBI look good.  Is it Viola's fault that Boston had no offense?  Is it *because* of Morris that the Blue Jays had such a strong offense?  Don't tell me that Morris has this magical ability to cause the offensive players to score more runs. This is the perfect example of your problem.  You are isolating Viola's contribution from the rest of the team's efforts.  You can only do this if you can say for sure what the team would have done without  Viola.  Only then can you compare.  But you cannot know how the team would have done without Viola.  Your analysis is fallacious.  OK, how about a straigh answer, then. Here's a very simele question to which I'm sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please answer yes or no, Roger:  Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs? AL only, please.  For anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact that a team's win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the team scores and the number the team allows. It's not a definite, hard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a rule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs, for every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game. So, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that they scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other things being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack Morris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238 for Boston), the ""Red Jays"" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or enough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn't take into account that Viola pitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in (particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs his team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this analysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would necessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but that is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and evaluate Viola's as better than Morris' in the sense that ""had Morris performed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.""  It takes an open mind to really truly understand what is happening out here in the real world guys.  This is true, but not so open that your brain falls out.

Back in September I was listening to WIP, and I remember the morning guys were talking with Mayor Ed Rendell.  The topic of conversation was a new ball park for the Phillies.  The location for this new park was suggested to be near 30th St Station.  At the time, the mayor was optimisitic that in the future this could become a reality.  Has there been any new news on this subject or is it still a pipe dream? I know the city of Philadelphia has other projects ahead, such as the new convention center and the upcoming Spectrum II.  But it would be nice to see this a reality.  It is planned that the Phillies leave the VET and leave it solely to the Eagles (and if that's the case, the Eagles should make the VET a grass stadium, but that's another story).  I want to see that day!  comments?

Take, for example, Mark McGwire. He walked 90 times in 1993. If that's not a potential great example of what you're talking about then I don't know what is. Now let's look at what happens when McGwire doesn't walk:   75% of the time he made an out.   10% of the time he hit a single.   5% of the time he hit a double.   10% of the time he hit a homer. Now, you're pitching against McGwire. Would you trade 20 walks for 2 homers, 1 double, 2 singles, and 15 outs? I would. Why give him the base when you can get him out 3 times out of 4? Then there are guys like Alex Cole, who has a career .363 OBP even though he's never had a batting average over .300 (he did hit .300 in 227 AB in 1990) or hit a single home run. Yep, that's right, he's *never* hit a homer in 916 AB's through the end of 1992. Who'd be afraid to throw a strike to him?

IMHO, to  have Williams, a streaky hitter (and not really a clutch hitter) batting 4th ahead of Bonds is simply an injustice to the Giants and fans of the Giants.  (2)   Having Bonds batting behind Williams means that Matt will get       more good pitches to hit.  This is important since he struggles       so much with breaking balls.  Opposing pitchers don't want to       walk Williams to get to Bonds.   You're definitely correct in that Williams absolutely has to be sandwiched in between Clark and Bonds.  He must, and I mean MUST, get fastballs to hit...otherwise he becomes little more than Sixto Lezcano in disguise. What I would suggest is perhaps batting Bonds, Williams, and Clark 3-4-5, the reason being that I feel Bonds' potential basestealing abilities are wasted when he's stuck behind two slow runners. I think the chance of getting 20-30 extra stolen bases with Bonds in the 3 spot would more than offset any drop in in run production by having  Clark in the 5 spot.  Matt

I don't remember why they said that it did not work.  Anyone remember this?  Jody McDonnel on WIP in Phil. has been saying that a pitch clock was inevitable.  How would a pitch clock work on throws to first?  Maybe we could limit the number of throws to first that the pitcher can make, and award a balk if he exceeds it.  I'd have another question:  who would  operate the pitch clock?  One of the umpires?  Add another one to the crew?  Another pair of suggestions: 1. Remove the Balk rule.  It is the runners responsibility to stay ""safe""    no matter what the pitcher does.  I'm not sure I like this idea.  I think it would severely diminish the  number of stolen bases and limit the availability of such neat strategic ploys as the hit and run and the squeeze play (one of my personal favorites).  2. If a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than X time (X = 3 to 5)    without successfully picking off the runner, the runner advances a base    as if walked.  Ahhh!  I suppose I should read the whole article before I hit the 'f' key, eh?  Obviously, from what I wrote above, I like this idea.  The no-balk seems to give the pitcher the advantage.  The base-walk allows the runner to ""challenge"" pitcher to throw over to the base.  It may also increase the number of wild throws to the bag, since the  pitcher knows he doesn't have very many chances to pick off the runner, so he may hurry too much.  I'd rather see runs scored as the result of  sound hitting and sound baseball strategy rather than on the sloppiness that could result from this kind of rule.  So, I suppose there are some disadvantages to that idea too.  | Baseball games take about 2:51 in the NL, and just a shade under 3 hours | in the AL.  That's just too damn long.

That may be a little  harsh for the majors, but seriously, how about putting a limit on the  batters being able to step out, take several dozen practice swings, pound their shoes, scratch their balls, etc.?

I was also at  the Saturday game in Montreal (Apr 17) that Rockies won 9-1. I haven't  paid much attention to Gallarraga since he left the Expos but his stance  seemed to be MUCH different. He stands more erect and very open, with his  left foot pointing to 3rd base. I'm wondering if this is a recent change  in stance for him? Andres had one glaring weakness as a hitter. He could  always be fooled by a curve ball low and away. If this is indeed a new  stance for him, maybe he is not being fooled as easily?  Yes, the stance is new.  Don Baylor was his batting coach at St. Louis last year, and now, as his manager, is continuing to work with him.  Maybe Andres has a ""weak"" left eye and the open stance gives him a better look at the ball.  Or maybe it is simply improving his mechanics - I dunno.  But the change seems to have enabled him to hit the ball as well as 5 years ago.  His selectivity has not changed.

Lesse:            '93 offense = '92 offense + (Thompson & Incaviglia)                        '92 offense = 72 wins                      '93 division winners = (at least) 88 wins              So,                              88 wins = 72 wins + (Thompson & Incaviglia)  Therefore,                16 wins = Thompson & Incaviglia  What did you learn in school today?  If you take a math course and your teacher turns out to be Rob Rains, run, don't walk, to drop/add.                                                                  P. Tierney    You obviously don't know what the hell you're talking about.  No,  Thompson and Incaviglia don't equal 16 wins, but I'll take the two  of them over Stan Javier and Ruben Amaro (.249 1HR, 334AB &  .219 7HR 374 AB)  I'd say this improvement should equate to 6or 7  wins at least.    Then, I'll take Lenny Dykstra who played 85 games last year and  project his numbers (.301, 104 hits, 18 2B's, 6 HR, 39RBI, 30 SB)  over 150 games. Thus(.301, 188 hits, 32 2B's, 11HR, 70RBI, 54 SB)  Okay, now we'll put these numbers in the leadoff hole and thus  I have to bump Kruk, Hollins, Daulton RBI numbers up just a tad...  now lesse... they knocked in 70, 93, and 109 respectively.  Don't  you think it's fair to add about 5 or 6 RBI to each?  They managed  to knock in a pretty nice amount of runs with a .219 leadoff hitter.  Okay bozo, do you think it's fair to add maybe 7 or 8 more wins  now?    Oh, and how can I forget Wes Chamberlain, 275 AB's 9 HR,   41 RBI even WITH a month and 1/2 in AAA and a horrible first half.  Well project that over a full season to get 18 HR and 80 RBI or so.  Is that worth a win or two?      Finally, take the *worse* pitching staff in the NL last year, add  the worse injury decimation of 1992.  Okay, now we add Danny  jackson, some health, and a full season for Schilling... is that  worth at least 3 wins?    Okay we've been conservative and added about 18 wins so far.  Now  we're adding about 4 more wins thanks to the expansion teams...  Okay, thats 22 wins.  Lesse dipshit math genuious, 72 + 22 = 94  Hmmm... I think thats good enough to win the worse division in  baseball?    Next time, before you say something foolish, get a clue first!       Actually, I was simply relaying the reasoning of this so-called genius BW writer.  I agree.  The reasoning was foolish.    Next time, before you say something foolish, be aware what you are responding to.  BTW, 94 wins.  Very funny.                                                                    P. Tierney"

We certainly believe this kid is going to be very good some day, but there is really no need to rush him, especially since we have a mega- million dollar staff that is probably well served by a battery-mate who is expereienced in game calling and pitcher handling.  Lopez' time will come.  Let's give him some time in AAA.   Javy Lopez has proven, over 1400+ AB in the minor leagues, that he is ready to play in the majors. He is *not* being rushed. Players who are clearly too good for AA and play behind stiffs at the major league level are wasting their time, and may actually have a court case against major league management for keeping them, at AAA.  No.  Maybe I need to improve my writing skills.  Lopez, who is very ordinary defensively, is not likely to hit so well at age 22   Unless Lopez is *me* defensively (I'm 5'7'', 165 and born to play second base :-)), he belongs in the major leagues.  training.  What does he have to do to earn a chance?  Maybe not a full time job, but at least a couple starts and a few AB for him to prove his worth?  Gee.  I don't know.  17 abs sounds pretty good to me!  About as good as your reasoning that the kid should play a back-up role rather than start every day at AAA.  Talk about *me* as a GM...  Valentine isn't saying he should back up. He's saying he should be put in a position to *win* the job in the major leagues, which, IMHO, he would if given the opportunity. (Val, if I'm misinterpreting, please let me know.)  So far you have come up with two arguments against Lopez: 1) He is very ordinary defensively. 2) He is young, and most players suck when they are young.  The first is irrelevant.  He's trying to make the majors with his bat. And the second involves seriously warped reasoning.  -Valentine  OK.  Most players are not ready for the bigs at age 22 (see current related posting on Clayton, one of my favorites).  Most players  benefit, rather than being stagnant or hurt, by playing at AAA. Most catchers need to be solid defensively players to help their clubs in the bigs.  Those are the arguments against Lopez for the Braves for this year.  But the players who *are* ready are 1)the best and 2) the ones most likely to benefit from being in the majors. Javy Lopez is not a middle- of-the-road prospect. He's the real thing. NOW.   Again, the most important thing a player can do is hit. Lopez does that miles better than Olson or Berryhill. If his defense is good enough for Greenville, or Richmond, it's good enough for Atlanta. If he really was awful defensively, he would no longer be a catcher. See Sprague, Ed.  Now.  The Braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid abilities to call games, to work with the pitchers, to throw out runners.  Not superstars mind you, but solid, experienced veterans. The Braves have a very solid lineup with two big bats in the outfield, an excellent platoon at first, a solid MVP candidate at third and one of the better hitting shortstops.  The center field platoon will probably hit .300.  However good Lopez' what they have to offset the differential in experience and  defensive ability.  The kid *will* improve playing at AAA, and he probably won't being a reserve with the big club.    Oh, where to start... OK. First of all, solid != good. I want good players. Solid is one of those words used to describe nice white guys who really aren't very good at baseball. Think of it as ""TWG"" without the caps. It's a losing strategy to say, ""We have solid guys, we don't need to improve."" You used it four times in that paragraph, BTW.  Same for experienced. I might add, though, that Greg Olson and Damon Berryhill aren't exactly Carter and Fisk. Olson has played three years, Berryhill five, although 90 and 91 were a wash. The only difference, IMHO, between Olson and Valle is the supporting cast.  ""Two big bats."" Hrm. I like Justice, but I find Mr. Gant's trend disturbing. Call it one and a maybe. The Braves' platoon is OK, but neither player has *any* value outside of the platoon. Bream vs. LH and Hunter vs. RH are awful. I'll leave the thirdbase comment alone. Pendleton has wasted too much bandwidth already. If the CF platoon hits .300, I'll retrace Mr. Likhani's midnight run down Forbes, and I live in NY and LA. (Got that, Mike?)  And doesn't Cox call pitches, anyway?  goodness.  Do you believe the other poster who thinks Lopez is being held down because of his future earning potential? Why on earth do you people thinkthe Braves made this decision? Are they idiots who have built this ballclub?  Jeeeesh...  Nope.

rec_sport_baseball;"From: dtate+@pitt.edu (David M. Tate) Subject: MVP '92 Revisited  Tim Shippert recently posted summaries of last year's Defensive Average stats in terms of the Linear Weights estimated run-value of defensive performances, compared to league average.  I've combined those with my position-adjusted MLV numbers to come up with first-approximation total run values for players last year.  We can use these as a springboard for reconsideration of the MVP award.  Major caveats:  these numbers include no defensive park adjustment, so if San Diego really is just a question of odd scoring or gopher holes in the infield, that will cause some inaccuracies.  The offensive numbers are position-adjusted, but not park adjusted, so we have to deflate some and inflate others to be fair.  Finally, we still don't know what to do about catchers, and I have no idea how to evaluate the defensive contributions  of Tony Phillips and Bip Roberts.    Having said that, there are still some surprises.  Let's look National League first.  All numbers in total runs contributed over the season.  	Player		Offense		Defense		Total  	Sandberg	  44		  32		 76 	Bonds		  67		   3		 70 	Walker		  26		  26		 52 	Justice		  14		  33		 47 	Daulton	 	  44		  ??		 44+? 	Larkin		  36		   4		 40 	Grace		  13		  27		 40  As I see it, these are the legitimate MVP candidates from last season. If you deflate Sandberg's offense a wee bit for playing in Wrigley, you get essentially a dead heat.  Had Bonds been his usual defensive self, it wouldn't have been close, but that apparently wasn't the case.  Darren Daulton needs 22 or more defensive runs to make up the offensive difference, and I couldn't tell you whether that's easy or impossible.  A good case  could be made for any of Sandberg, Bonds, or Daulton as top dude.  My personal vote:  Bonds, Sandberg, Daulton, Walker, Justice.   In the American League:  	Player		Offense		Defense		Total  	Ventura		  22		  34		 56 	Martinez	  47		  -1		 46 	B. Anderson 	  21		  25		 46 	Thomas		  47		  -5		 42 	R. Henderson	  25		  16		 41 	Raines		  17		  23		 40 	Tettleton	  33		  ??		 33+?  OK, let's see a show of hands: how many of you picked Robin Ventura as top player in the AL last year?  I certainly didn't, but I'd have a hard time arguing against him at this point.  Yes, I know these numbers are only approximate, but that's a big gap between him and the #2 guy.  Also, those of you who thought Rickey Henderson stank last year are out of your minds.  Once again, there's a catcher in the ointment.  If calling a game is as important as it might be, 23 runs is easy to make up (or give away).  TAke a guess, folks  I don't think we can do any better than that.  My personal vote (excluding pitchers):  	Ventura, Tettleton, Anderson, Martinez, Henderson.  I'm a big Frank Thomas fan, but I have to admit to a bias in favor of balanced offensive/defensive contribution, which should have a higher leverage in W/L record than an equal shift that is lots of offense with negative defense.  For the record:  	Carlos Baerga		  27		  5		  32 	Roberto Alomar		  35		 -2		  33  Forget it  it's a wash.  Let me also take this opportunity to admit that I was grossly wrong regarding Don Mattingly's defense this past season.  Don recovered brilliantly from his weak '90 and '91 to end up with  	Mattingly		  -1		  17		  16 runs  which is clearly an above-average first baseman.  However, it's still 18 runs behind Mark McGwire, 26 runs behind Frank Thomas, and 7 runs behind John Olerud.  On the other hand, it's ahead of Rafael Palmeiro, Cecil Fielder, and every other AL first baseman not yet mentioned.  --     David M.

I definitely do.  That's why I don't like going to see games played on artificial turf :-)  The lengthier games are so because of batters stepping out of the box, pitchers taking longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers and pitching coaches.  And while it's true that the gaps between plays can be interesting, this is only true when they don't become extra-long.  Well, your idea of ""interesting"" differs from mine.  I think batting practice is interesting, for example, and make a special effort to get to the game very early in order to see it.  I think the delaying tactics of batters, pitchers, catchers, and managers are interesting because they're attempts to gain advantage through control of the flow and timing of the game.  Of course, the umpires can, and should, intervene when these tactics get out of hand.  As Ryan Robbins has pointed out, there are rules that cover this.  One of the more fascinating things about baseball, I think, is its open-endedness with regard to time.  You never know if the game is going to zip right by and be over in less than two hours, or if it's going to go on until four in the morning.  Likewise, some games are action-packed, and some games are slow and lazy.  That's fine by me.  Those folks who want constant action should watch the games on TV so they can channel- surf and cater to their short attention spans.  Heather HHENDERSON@vax.clarku.edu"

Mattingly is a below average fielder.    Before you start up, yes, I have proof. There are really only two  adequate ways to measure fielding prowess. the first, which has the  advantage of being applicable to older players, since it uses raw data  available for almost all of MLB history, is the Total Chances per Game  method favored by the Total Baseball people among others. It basically  says that you measure a fielder by how many balls he gets to.   But it is subject to all kinds of bias, and is almost completely useless for first basemen.  From the raw stats, there is no way to tell which of a first baseman's putouts were made on throws from other fielders, and which were made on his own plays  likewise, you can't tell whether a double play was 6-4-3 or 3-6-3.  Fielding Runs thus gives a first baseman no credit for putouts or double plays, only for assists and errors.    It thus favors first basemen who play deep, reaching a lot of balls but forcing the pitcher to cover first more frequently.  It also hurts first baseman who play behind left-handed pitching staffs and thus face few left-handed batters.   A better method, but newer and based ondata that has only been collected  over the last few years, measures the percentage of balls hit into the  part of the field the guy is responsible for.   This is better  of course, it still isn't all of a first baseman's defense.   Some references: Mattingly's 1992 defensive rating, STATS method, from  Mike Gimbel's Baseball Player and Team Ratings: -1.  Defensive Average, which uses larger (and probably better) zones, has Mattingly tied for second in the league.   On the other hand, he has contributed 233 runs by his batting  actions, a pretty healthy number.   While 233 batting runs is good, it is mostly in the past  the runs he produced in 1986 don't say much about his value in 1993.    -- David Grabiner, grabiner@zariski.harvard.edu ""We are sorry, but the number you have dialed is imaginary.""

Studying 1986 and 1992 videotapes of Jose Canseco proved to be very interesting.  And enlightening.  Here's my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep '92, and Jose Canseco, circa June 1986.  1.  He's bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,     not gain more bulk.  2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I'd say he's     lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed.  3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like     Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is     released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -     Canseco can't.  Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his     stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,     they're fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it's hard     to make adjustments in your swing.  What would I do, if I were Jose?  Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch, so that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing.  First, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance, and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this will cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move the bathead more freely.  Second, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.  Third, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find my 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling the wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength  is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of the park.  If Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back problems, he'll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could still hit 600+ HR.   --  *   Gary Huckabay   * ""You think that's loud enough, a$$hole?""           * *   ""Movie Rights   * ""Well, if you're having trouble hearing it, sir,   * *   available thru  *  I'd be happy to turn it up for you.

That would take care of position  corrected anomolies such as Frank's.  Since that is not the case (and why  not?  Is it always this way?) then we are going to have trouble finding the  true value of DHs using the same models as that for position players.  There are several reasons for this difference.  The main reason is that good hitters in their prime (such as Frank Thomas and Danny Tartabull) are rarely regular DH's, even if they can't field  it's more commonly a place to put aging veterans.  Another use of the DH slot is to help a player come back from injury slowly, getting his bat in the lineup without forcing him to play in the field.  I would expect such players to hit worse as DH's than they did during the rest of the season.  A third factor is that most player who split time between DH and first or the outfield don't hit as well as DH's for some reason.  Reggie Jackson was a good example  in five years as a RF/DH for the Angels, he hit like the old Reggie when he was in right.  The second and third factors will be lost if players are considered by their primary position only  a player who plays 90 games in right and 60 at DH will count only in the right fielders' averages.   	A logical starting place would be to look at defensive replacement  value (if you can find it) for 1B or LF or something.  We can assume that  if forced to play defense they would play at true zero value, even though I  doubt this is actually true for players like Winfield and Molitor.  This  would let us ""discount"" the time they spend playing DH, because that  forces the team to find another real fielder to play.  This makes sense  you might also look at it another way.  Although the *average* offensive performance of a DH may be lower than for a left fielder, the *replacement-level* offensive performance is certainly lower  if you are a left fielder but can't hit well enough to keep a job anywhere, then you certainly can't hit well enough to keep a job at DH.   -- David Grabiner, grabiner@zariski.harvard.edu ""We are sorry, but the number you have dialed is imaginary.""

I was also at the Saturday game in Montreal (Apr 17) that Rockies won 9-1. I haven't paid much attention to Gallarraga since he left the Expos but his stance seemed to be MUCH different. He stands more erect and very open, with his left foot pointing to 3rd base. I'm wondering if this is a recent change in stance for him? Andres had one glaring weakness as a hitter. He could always be fooled by a curve ball low and away. If this is indeed a new stance for him, maybe he is not being fooled as easily? As for his patience,  Dennis Martinez definitely did not have his good stuff. If he was grooving pitches to Andres, you can hardly fault him for drilling them (which he did!). Does Andres generally start hot or cold? Does it take until May for most pitchers to have confidence in that curve ball low and away?  Roger Healey

Gant may have said something here, too.  7)  Hirschbeck yells at Gant.  Gant is silent. 8)  Hirschbeck calls for the pitch. 9)  Pitch is called a strike. 10)  Cox argues (couldn't see when he came on the field)  Cox was already halfway to the ump when the strike was called.  11)  Cox is ejected, players everywhere 12)  Play finally resumes.  Gant shouldn't have ignored Hirschbeck.  Not returning made the strike call fairly likely.  Although I suspect an argument might have gotten Gant tossed altogether.  But if Hirschbeck had let Gant step out, the whole incident probably would have been avoided.  My impression was that Gant was not 'stepping out.'  He was making a protest about the lack of an appeal to first.  As has been pointed out earlier, there is no appeal to first on a strike. I can understand Gant feeling a little pressure in a two-out, RISP, 1 - 0 game, ninth inning.  He let it get to him.  The ump also overreacted.  Gant was stalking off, but I doubt he would have been gone long.  Hirschbeck should have let him have a moment to compose himself before telling him to come bat. IMHO, umpires should be more flexible than what Hirschbeck showed.  Gant was disturbed to the point it was pretty likely he would not get a hit.  A very bad finish to a pretty good game. -- Dale J.

Those are the arguments against Lopez for the Braves for this year.  Now.  The Braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid abilities to call games, to work with the pitchers, to throw out runners.    	This is the crux of the argument (to me at least).  Both the SDCN and the non-SDCN camps seem to agree on the fact that a catcher's defense is basically nonmeasurable at present.  You can talk about how important calling a game is, or framing the pitches, or blocking balls in the dirt.  But there is little or no way to tell exactly how various catcher's rank in ""defense"".    	Looking at Lopez specifically  is there any reason to suspect that he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the Braves (or the media) has labeled him a bad defensive catcher?  As far as I can tell he doesn't have any particular problem in his mechanics (such as Sasser).  He might be a little rough around the edges in blocking the ball, or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to clear that up is playing and practice time.  I can't see how repetitions at AAA are any better then reps in the majors!    	All we're left with is the calling the game aspect.  Olsen  and Berryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping the pitchering staff.  But this is a reputation that is given to almost all veteran catchers.  How is catching at AAA going to help Lopez learn the major league pitching staff?  The only way any catcher is going to learn Tom Glavine's pitches is to catch Tom Glavine.  Similarly, I wouldn't be supprised if the pitcher's claimed to prefer pitching to Olsen over pitching to Lopez because they are used to pitching to Olsen.  But  given time they will say they are comfortable with Lopez.  	Now, since Lopez can't learn how to handle the major league pitcher's while he's in AAA and since he doesn't have any glaring problem in his mechanics, what is he going to learn in AAA that he can't learn just as well while in the majors?

Baerga's was .486-.424 and .392-.318. Pretty clearly, Alomar got a HUGE boost from his home park.  Not necessarily.  It could mean that, or it could mean that he just hit a lot better at home than he did on the road (see Frank Thomas' home/road splits in '91 for an example).  I would guess that some of Alomar's split is due to the Skydome, but most of it is probably due just to coincidence. There's no way to be sure, of course, but the only hitters the Skydome seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters, and Alomar is not a home run hitter.  I'd say you could make a good for them being about equal right now. T&P rated Baerga higher, actually.  Only because of t&P's bogus fielding stats, which rate Alomar as the worst defensive second baseman in the league.  On a career basis, I think T&P's fielding stats may mean something, but on a seasonal basis it comes up with ridiculous results like this.  Alomar may not be the god of fielding the media says he is, but he sure isn't the worst in baseball.  Offensively, T&P rate Alomar much higher last year.

Also, the lead a pitcher enters with cannot  excede three runs.  I believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in  determining winners/savers/etc.  For instance, a pitcher can come in in the  ninth with a lead, blow the lead, fall behind, have his team come back in  the next half inning and earn the win.  Has this pitcher earned a win, no  way.  I guy could pitch five strong innings of middle relief and see his  teammates rally to tie the score.  Assume he came in to start the fourth  and left after the eighth.  His teammate holds the opposition scoreless in  the ninth and they score a run in the bottom of the ninth to win.

Offense and defense are equally important.  But the pitcher is 80% of the defense.  The primary role of every other player is on offense.  Even shortstops are a bigger part of the offensive game than of the defensive game.  (They might not do much with their part of the offense, but that's another issue.)  That being said, I think both Smith and Yount deserve the HOF.  They hit pretty well in addition to their defense.  Cheers, -Valentine

So who cares which PLAYER gets credited, as long as the TEAM gets more runs?  If a player helps the TEAM get more R and RBI, but  doesn't score them all himself, who cares?  Amusing, isn't it?  Seems only the SDCNs realize how much baseball is a *team* game, combining efforts from every player for the win.  Consider the Red Sox game last night.  The Sox won 4-3 in the bottom of the 13th.  Who won the game?  -Clemens pitched a strong nine (?) innings, allowing only two runs. -Ryan pitched a couple shutout innings, though he needed some excellent  defensive plays behind him to do so. -Quantrill pitched a couple of innings, gave up the go-ahead run, and  got credited with the win when the Sox scored two in the bottom of  the inning.  Looks like a team effort to me!  Yet only Quantrill got credit for the win.  How about the offense? -Dawson and Vaughn hit (I think) HRs early in the game.  Without either  one, the Sox would have lost in nine. -Quintana led off the 13th with a solid single. -Zupcic pinch-ran for Quintana, providing the speed to go from first  to third when... -Cooper ripped a *second* single in the inning. -Melvin avoided the DP, getting the run home with a sac fly.  Not much of  a help, but it was something. -Scrub Richardson then hit a double, scoring the speedy Cooper all the  way from first!  (Hill's lack of defense helped.)  Cooper and Zupcic were credited with runs, Melvin and Richardson were credited with RBIs.  But it seems to me that it was Quintana's hit that set up the whole inning!  And did Melvin really contribute as much as Richardson?  Furthermore, people seem to consider RBIs to be more significant than runs.  Did Melvin contribute more than Cooper?  Cooper provided the game-winning baserunner, and moved the tying run to third base with only one out!  Assigning credit based on Runs and RBIs is clearly ridiculous.  You can argue that OBP and SLG don't show you who came through in the clutch, but R&RBI don't do any better.  At least OBP and SLG don't *claim* to try to tell you that.  Here's to the Red Sox who contributed to last night's victory. All 20 of them!  -Valentine

Only in extreme cases, like dust in the pitcher's or hitter's eyes, should an umpire call time.  The batter has 20 seconds to get situated in the box and receive a pitch. I'm against putting a giant clock (or any size clock for that matter) up to count down 20 seconds between pitches and the minute for warm-ups. But I think umpires should tell hitters to go to hell if they step out to get the sign or whatever, and instruct the pitcher to pitch. The same goes for pitchers. Umps should tell them to pitch or feint within 20 seconds or a ball will be called. That's the way it should be.   Ryan Robbins Penobscot Hall University of Maine  IO20456@Maine.Maine.Edu

So, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805 drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I'd love to get another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next generation of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my system and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're broken.  	If you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805 cards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB), at least until their developers are ""less busy"".

ISA has no bus arbitration, so if two busmastering cards in 1 ISA system try to do DMA xfers on the same DMA channel the system will lock or  crash.(I forget)  Their are 8 DMA channels in an ISA system. 0-7. 0-3 are 8-bit & 4-7 are 16-bit.

My computer is a DTK 286-12 IBM clone.  Simple.  First, Andrew is correct, although I can see where there might be some confusion.  It is indeed possible to have two cards *configured* to use the same interrupt.  They can not *share* the interrupt in the sense that it is not possible to have both cards active at the same time.  Here is an example.  For some time, I was short of ""free interrupts.""  I had a tape controller (not a ""floppy tape"") that needed one of IRQ0-IRQ7.  (It's an *old* tape drive.)  My solution was to use IRQ3 (also used for COM2, where my modem is).  I did this because I reasoned I would never be using the modem and the tape simultaneously.  When kermit runs, it installs its own interrupt handler for IRQ3 and uses the serial port.  If the tape drive were to generate an interrupt, kermit would not have a clue what to do with/for the tape controller.  (And since the tape controller would not be serviced, it would most likely ""hang."")  Likewise, when the tape backup software runs, it installs an interrupt handler for IRQ3.  That handler won't do anything for the serial port.  Under DOS, printing is NOT interrupt-driven.  Instead, the BIOS polls the status of the parallel port to determine when another byte may be sent.

If there is source on this kind of info,  please let me know. I just got a 286 station (around 21*16.5*7 in dimension), and I am thinking about upgrade it to a 486 or 386.          The station has a power supply, two floppy disk drives, and the big case. I have SONY 1304 monitor, SyQuest drive (Mac), and maybe a cd-rom reader (Mac) for it. Here are the questions I have so far: 1) Is there a 486 motherboard at this dimension that I could use the case? 2) The original owener has the controller for floppy drive and hard disk removed. Can I use them to control these devices under 486? How much do I have to pay for a new controllers if the old ones won't work? 3) How can I make SyQuest (SCSI) and cd-rom (SCSI) work on this station?  I heard that there is a cheap sound board that has SCSI controller built-in? What's quality of this board? How much usually does a SCSI control cost? Is there any ftp sites that has SyQuest driver or cd-rom driver for the PC if I can have everything hooked up OK?4) What I want is a 486 motherboard, a sound board to make it a MPC-  quality station. How much would it cost to do that? Is it worth the hussle than just buy a new 486 station? BTW, I need to buy a keyboard for it too.  Any input is welcome.  Thank you.  Peter Liu

I just bought the new soundblaster 16 and tried to  install the card. The sb16 uses 16bit DMA channel.I could select between channel 5 to 7. It is the first card I ever installed that uses 16bit dma transfer. After I tested the card the first time, the computer crashed and I got a parity error-system halted. This happens either from dos as also from windows. So it seems that my 16 bit dma channels are not working properly (they are there because testsb16.exe recocnize them and tests them ok until first access).   Well, does anybody know a solution for this problem or a special test program for dma problems? I eliminated the  problem temporaly by using only 8 bit dma channel but it makes the system slow!

To put it a little differently:   - IRQ 7 is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the    printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity.   - DOS doesn't monitor IRQ 7  it uses other means to determine when it's    time to send out another byte to the printer.   - Most (all?) (hardware) printer adapters have the ability to disable    the use of IRQ 7, usually by merely breaking the connection between    the ISA pin and the associated driver.  Other adapters control the    IRQ line by a tri-state driver, and by programming just leave it    in the high-impedence mode.   - Unfortunately, there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate    drivers (i.e., either assert high or assert low) for the IRQ lines    rather than tristate drivers (assert high, assert low, or don't    assert anything).  The presence of such a card on an IRQ line precludes    the use of that IRQ by any other adapter unless it is physically     disconnected by a jumper.     (Incidentally, note that there's no requirement that a card hold    the IRQ line low when no interrupt is desired.  If that were true    you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected IRQ lines, and    that certainly isn't a requirement.)   - Non-DOS operating systems (OS/2, NT (?), various Unices or whatever the    proper plural of Unix might be) require the use of IRQ 7 for performance    reasons.    And the SB16, alas, is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers.  Joe Morris / MITRE  (jcmorris@mitre.org)

However, the date and time remain correct.  If anyone knows what can be causing this, please let me know.  Most likely reason is that your backup battery is failing - this battery  maintains the contents of the CMOS memory when AC power is turned off, and if the battery is flakey then the contents of the CMOS will be lost and  the checksum will be wrong (along with most other of the CMOS data). Try  replacing the battery.  If, however, your PC doesn't use a battery but a large capacitor to power the CMOS, you should check to see if you can replace the capacitor with a  more normal lithium battery. If this isn't possible, make sure you leave your PC on for a half hour or hour each day  this will keep the capacitor  charged. I'd opt for the battery change, though.  It's also possible, but unlikely that a rogue problem or even a virus is  corrupting the CMOS. If your battery seems okay, get a virus scanner and check out your system.

I have checked that there are no conflict in BIOS addresses, IRQ & I/O port. Have I missed anything?  I am lost here. Any suggestions are most welcomed. Thanks in advance.

There is explicitly NO WARRANTY that the given settings are correct or harmless. (I only collect, I do not check for myself!!!). There is always the possibility that the settings may destroy your hardware! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Since I hope however that only well-minded people undergo the effort of posting their settings the chance of applicability exists. If you should agree or disagree with some setting, let me know immediately in order to update the list.  If you possess a HD not mentioned here of which you know BIOS and/or jumper settings, please mail them to me for the next update of the list!  Only IDE (AT-Bus) Harddisks will be accounted for. If not specified the Landing Zone should be set equal to the number of cylinders. If not specified the 'Write Precompensation' should be set 65535. (There are BIOSes that don't even ask for it).  Another statement (maybe right): IDE harddisk don't have Precomp and LZone. The precomp is a built-in parameter and lzone isn't used because most if not every IDE disk has autopark.  The jumpers' names are given as printed on the HD's board, often only a jumper number (JP12 means the jumper '12'). A zero means that the jumper is left open, a one means that the jumper is closed.    ***************************   C O N N E R   ***************************   		Conner Peripherals Drive Geometry  IDE/AT  Conner drives are low level formatted at the factory.

However, when doing writes to the Caviar, once  in a while it would overwrite directories etc. Using FASTBACK was almost  impossible.    The workaround is to install the Caviar as the master, and the Conner  as the slave.    ***************************    F U J I T S U      ***************************  DETAILS OF FUJITSU DRIVES M261xT (Standard)                     M2614ET     M2613ET     M2612ET     M2611T  Heads (physical)       8           6           4           2 Cyl (physical)      1334        1334        1334        1334 Sec/trk               33          33          33          33 Speed (rpm)         3490        3490        3490        3490 Capacity           180MB       135MB        90MB        45MB                 +-----------------------------------------------+               |                                               |               +--+                                            |         PSU   |  |      CNH-2                                 |               +--+          1                                 |             1 |  |          .

I a single drive environment the drive is described as a Master.    In a dual drive environment the drives are described as a Master and a Slave. This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives  when performing diagnostics.    There are four links, LK1, LK2, LK4 and LK5, adjacent to the 40 way  interface connector. They have the following functions and are described  in order as viewed from the end of the drive, with the first jumper  described nearest the 40 way interface connector.  LK2: LED       When fitted, this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the      interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An      external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with      the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will      be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130      Ohms ot 220 Ohms.  LK1: Dual Drives      This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single      bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector,      indicating, to the Master drive, the presence of a Slave.  LK4: Master      When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If      there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be      jumpered in this way.  LK5: IOChRdy      When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive, it is       fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher      data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per      second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally       fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per      second.     There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s) may be jumpered:       Master, single drive with LED on interface		LK2 & LK4 fitted.      Master, single drive without LED on interface	LK4 only fitted.      Master, dual drive without LED on interface	LK4 & LK1 fitted.      Slave, dual drive without LED on interface		No jumpers fitted.      Master, dual drive with LED on interface		LK4, LK1 & LK2 fitted.      Slave, dual drive with LED on interface		LK2 only fitted.     The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to reduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used.     The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way  connector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected by the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the  drive for this LED driver.

When I installed a Conner CP3204F (203 MB) as master and a WD Caviar 2200  (203 MB) as slave, both with and without the ""CP"" jumper, the Caviar had  seemingly normal behaviour. However, when doing writes to the Caviar, once  in a while it would overwrite directories etc. Using FASTBACK was almost  impossible.    The workaround is to install the Caviar as the master, and the Conner  as the slave.

comp_sys_ibm_pc_hardware;From: gwesp@cosy.sbg.ac.at (Gerhard Wesp) Subject: DataSave Videostreamer   A few weeks ago I saw an ad in the German magazine c't about a so-called Videostreamer. This is an interface between a PC's parallel port and any video-recorder for backing up your data on a videotape. The company (DataSave?) claims that it can store up to 7 GB on a 300 minutes tape.                            It costs DM 250.- (about USD 200, I think)  My question is:  Does anybody use this product, if yes, how many bytes   REALLY fit on a 300 minutes tape (7 GB sounds quite  unbelievable to me).   However, any comments on the interface are appreciated. Please mail your replies directly to me, I will sum up if neccesary. Thanks in advance...  -Gerhard (gwesp@cosy.sbg.ac.at)

It appears to function OK, but is unhookable to anything standard (CGA,EGA,VGA) - it will plug in but gives fuzzy diagonal noise.  I also have a graphics board that is apparently a 3270 graphic board (double card with 2 8-bit bus connectors, and a 9-pin female connector with a picture of monitor). I tried plugging these two into a standard AT to no avail. How can one connect these to (the monitor seems to be of relatively high quality, so I'm curious)? Any special drivers and/or setup needed - I can't locate any jumpers on the card.

Yes, this is a valid concern IMHO.  With the directly attached fan units I've seen, it looks like if the fan were to stop the chip cooling would be  a good bit worse than no heat sink at all.  In other words, if the fan stops the unit turns into an insulator and the chip might get hot enough to suffer permanent damage, not just stop working temporarily.   I prefer to put a stock fan off the drive brackets or front panel  to blow air across the cpu - depends a lot on case and board layout, though.   My Zeos 486DX2/66 (tower case) has a passive heat sink on the cpu, and it's located so the front fan, which sucks air into the case, blows right on the heat sink.  If that fan stops the heat sink is still cooled by convection air flow so should not see too dramatic a temperature rise.  Essentially the  arrangement you're talking about and a good idea IMHO.   on-chip fans from Fry's Electronics in the SF Bay Area are about 30.00. I  get the stock power supply fans for about 11.00.    -steve --  Al DeVilbiss al@col.hp.com"

Previously, when I first start up my PC I can see all the  CMOS messages (RAM test ...etc) but now I've got to wait  for about 3min before the display shows anything and it starts up with a bright white flash.  This only happens when the system has been off for a long time (eg overnight). If it was only off for a couple of hours and then turned on again, the display works as normal like before.  Does anyone know what is causing this?  Is it a warning that it will give up soon or just signs of aging (the system is a 386sx and its about 3 yrs old).  I've used systems at work for years and never seen this happen to a monitor yet.  I'd really appreciated any help that you fellow netters can offer. Thanks a lot.

Will performance suffer that    much?  For a 200MB or so drive?  If I don't have a tape drive or CD-ROM?    Any help would be appreciated.  So, when you've got multi-tasking, you want to increase performance by increasing the amount of overlapping you do.  One way is with DMA or bus mastering.  Either of these make it possible for I/O devices to move their data into and out of memory without interrupting the CPU.  The alternative is for the CPU to move the data.  There are several SCSI interface cards that allow DMA and bus mastering.   How do you do bus-mastering on the ISA bus?  IDE, however, is defined by the standard AT interface created for the IBM PC AT, which requires the CPU to move all the data bytes, with no DMA.  If we're talking ISA (AT) bus here, then you can only have 1 DMA channel active at any one time, presumably transferring data from a single device. So even though you can have at least 7 devices on a SCSI bus, explain how all 7 of those devices can to DMA transfers through a single SCSI card to the ISA-AT bus at the same time.  Also, I'm still trying to track down a copy of IBM's AT reference book, but from their PC technical manual (page 2-93):  ""The (FDD) adapter is buffered on the I.O bus and uses the System Board direct memory access (DMA) for record data transfers."" I expect to see something similar for the PC-AT HDD adapter.   So the lowly low-density original PC FDD card used DMA and the PC-AT HDD controller doesn't!?!?  That makes real sense."

Will there be a noticable      decrease in access time/increase in Xfer rate?       For MSDOS applications, ISA-based SCSI and IDE controllers generally have comparable throughput.  You might get slightly higher throughput with a SCSI disk, but you'll also pay more for the disk ($30-$100 and up, in some cases).  You'll also pay much, much more for a good SCSI controller.       Note that good SCSI controllers really show their power if they're used with a good multitasking operating system (like a PC Unix). Unfortunately, neither MSDOS nor Windows 3.1 is a good multitasking operating system.  The performance advantage of SCSI controllers is mostly wasted with these, which leaves the advantage of being able to connect multiple devices to the SCSI bus as the only advantage. However, note that you can expect to pay a premium for SCSI devices.       If you're only going to be using MSDOS, stick with IDE.  It's cheaper, and you'll have less headaches.   4)  Will virtually any SCSI device chain into the controller for my      hard-drive (bernoulli box, CD-rom, Tape Drive, etc).  [ Note: the following is true for MSDOS/Windows only.  Who knows what   the future holds for Windows NT and Unix??? ]       No.  Generally, you have to find drivers for each SCSI device, which probably don't exist unless you're using one of the ""better""/""high performance"" SCSI controllers.  These are typically bus-mastering SCSI controllers that cost around $180-$400 (street prices) and up, and drivers that allow you to connect these controllers to popular name-brand SCSI devices either come with the card, or can be purchased (for under $100 list price).  Examples of such driver kits are:  * Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit (list: $75).  This works only with Adaptec SCSI   controllers.  * CorelSCSI! (from the same people who make CorelDRAW!) (list: $99 (?)).   This driver kit will supposedly work with any SCSI controller card   that has an ASPI driver, like the Adaptec.       Central Point's PC Tools for DOS 8.0 supports a number of SCSI tape drives (the documentation lists 40 tape drives).  Unfortunately, it works only with Adaptec controllers.   5)  Are there likely to be other problems/incompatibilities with a      SCSI controller and  sound cards/video accelerators/and similar      equipment.       Yes, you will run into problems, if you're using a high-performance, bus-mastering SCSI controller.  This doesn't sound right, doesn't it?  It's true, though.  With one of these controllers, you'll probably have to tweak your system to get it to work with sound cards, floppy-controller-based tape drives (like the CMS Jumbo 250), and Windows 3.1.  I know.  I've been to h*ll and back getting my SCSI controller to work with various hardware/software (thank God for tape backups).  If you want a copy of my ""Adaptec 1542 hints and tips"" file, send email.       These problems aren't really the fault of the SCSI controller card  the problems are really with the general hardware and software design of the PC (e.g., no standards).  However, adding a bus-mastering SCSI card is what brings these problems to the surface and makes them visible.       SCSI holds a lot of promise, but you can run into a lot of PC compatibility problems.  If you're planning on using only MSDOS/Windows 3.1, stick with IDE.  If you want to use Windows NT or a PC Unix, you'll have to make some hard decisions: a good SCSI controller and more than one SCSI hard disk will probably give you excellent performance, at the possible cost of MSDOS compatibility.  [ I say, ""probably"", because, while I know this to be true with a PC Unix, I don't know if this really will be true of Windows NT.  I suspect that it will, but I don't know for sure.  ]"

I believe floppy controller also uses DMA, and most A/D boards also use DMA.  DMA is no big deal, and has nothing to do directly with SCSI.  No.  The simple $25 style IDE controller does not use DMA.  The CPU performs the data transfer with a string move instruction.  This requires that the CPU stop what it had been doing and transfer the data.  Only the smart drive controllers, be they IDE or SCSI, can transfer via DMA.  These controllers tend to cost the same wether they are IDE or SCSI.  To get the DMA benefits, IDE must sacrifice it's price advantage *on the controller*.   For example, when rewinding or formatting a tape, the command is issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other devices on the bus.  This greatly increases productivity or, at least, do something else while backing up your hard drive :-).  Which happens to be what I am doing while reading this group.  You can thank your software for that.  If DOS had a few more brains, it could format floppies etc. while you were doing something else.  The hardware will support it, but DOS (at least) won't.  Again, this has    nothing to do with SCSI.  Floppies aren't on the IDE bus, your arguement makes no sense, this isn't an IDE issue.  The floppys have their own processor on their controller board which handles all of these commands.  The difference between IDE and SCSI is that all SCSI peripherials are intelligent.  They each have their own controller.  They depend on the CPU to do fewer things for them, i.e. IDE drives needing a processor to transfer their data.  Its a long story, but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which, thanks to SCSI, I can move between both machines.  If, and when, SCSI is better standardized and supported on the ibm-clone machines, I plan to completely get rid of IDE.  And if you stick with DOS you'll wonder why you can't multitask.  Again I ask why can't a UNIX or OS/2 type OS do all the miraculous things with an IDE harddrive that it can with a (single) SCSI hard drive.  The dettach/callback mechanism alows the CPU to make requests of the  devices on the SCSI bus and then dettach and go about its business. Later, when the device is done, it issues a callback to say that the data has arrived or the function has completed.  Most SCSI cards will also DMA the data into memory without the interupting the CPU, therefore allowing it to continue working uninterupted.  IDE supports no such concept as dettach/callback.

Data is data, and it could be anywhere on the drive.  Can SCSI find it faster?  can it get it off the drive and into the computer faster?  Does it have a better cache system?  I thought SCSI was good at managing a data bus when multiple devices are attached.  If we are only talking about a single drive, explain why SCSI is inherently faster at managing data from a hard drive. You are making the same mistake I did: you are confusing the DRIVE interface to the DATA THROUGHPUT interface.  Again from my Mac & IBM info sheet {available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare173.txt}: Expansion Both Mac & IBM SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.  Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card   expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  Apple developed some   specifications for SCSI controlers while IBM has no exact controller   specifications {which results in added incompatibilities on IBM machines}.    Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal   terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port   {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the   end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}.  SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}  and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base.  16-bit SCSI-1 requires a  SCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2  which are both 16-bit interfaces {see SCSI-2}. SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully  SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it   needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be   very expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst   {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst  {32-bit/wide and fast}.  SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode is limited to 7 devices and  reduced 8-bit or 16-bit {fast only} throughput due to the difference between  SCSI-1 and wide SCSI-2 ports.  IBM HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: [...] IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics   currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized   drives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max.  So at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES  the through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 mode it blows poor IDE out the window, down the street, and into the garbage can. The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put rates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOT the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the SCSI-2 through put.  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling prophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, which in turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its cost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the Rule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost}  SCSI-2 allows a drive mechanisims through put to be limited by the DRIVE while IDE itself limits the through put.

This is a common misconception, shared my many manufacturers, programmers, and users alike.  COM3, for example, is simply the third equipped COMM port, not necessarily the one with I/O address 3E8.  The BIOS just searches sequentially through a set of potential COMM port addresses.  The first equipped port it finds will become COM1, etc.  If you're playing by the rules, you can't have a COM4 unless you have a COM3 equipped.  The set of ""standard"" (whatever that means) port addresses merely reflects the order in which the BIOS searches the I/O address space in its search for serial ports.  So, what you have is indeed COM3 at the non-standard address 2E8.  Were this address in the 4th table slot instead, programs which query the BIOS to determine the number of installed COMM ports would not find it, as the field in the BIOS data area which contains this number would indicate that there are but 3 COMM ports installed.

My friend claims that there will be   little difference   in the temperature of an idle CPU and a CPU running a   computationally   intensive job.  From what I've seen in coursework, most CPUs never actually ""idle"".  They will continue to service interrupts, etc., etc.  The clock will always be running at n Mhz no matter what it's doing.  I suppose depending on the instruction, the CPU may use circuitry which has more transistors than other instructions, but if you consider the additional heat generated by only a handful of additional, tiny resistors and then spread that heat dissipation over the CPU's packaging, the change in temperature to the immediate environment (ie. the surface of the package) will be negligible.

I can tell you that mixing them  between 'banks' ok, and I can't see why mixing in one bank is not unless  they are of different speeds ( e.g. mixing of 60ns and 100ns SIMMs in one  bank ).  The two only differ in the type of chips it uses.  Assuming that  the SIMMS are 1Mx9 ( 9 bit wide ), here is the two equivalent  configuration.  The 3-chip SIMM uses two 4-bit wide 4Mbit (1M of 4-bit  nibbles ) and one 1-bit wide 1Mbit chip ( for a total of 9-bit wide 1Mbyte  ).  The 9-bit SIMM uses nine 1-bit wide 1Mbit chips.  These are equivalent  because of the way that it is 'pinned' on the SIMM board.  At the SIMM  interface, they both act as 9-bit wide 1MByte SIMMS ( 2*4+1=9*1 ).  [sorry  if too techie for ya].   MG 	Similarly, one cannot plug in two 1MB SIMMs and one 4MB SIMMs to  gi MG the system a total of 6 MEG. Why is that so ?? If my system supports MG of 8 MEG (it has 8 SIMM slots), can I plug in 4 4MB SIMMs to give my MG 16MB ??  That sounds correct.  the problem is that if your computer takes 9-bit  wide SIMMs, you can not mix different sizes in one bank.  Why you ask?   Simple,  if you understand why there is banks.  Assuming you have a 32-bit  CPU ( 386DX or 486 ), the data bus (e.g. the mechanism to retrieve data  from memory ) is 32-bits wide, so the computer expects to see 32 bits when  it asks for data.  To get that bandwidth ( 32-bit wide ), the motherboard  links 4 1Mx9 ( one bit is not data, but parity, so I will ignore that in  this simple explaination ) to get 32bits [ (9-1)*4=32 bits ].  That means  that a SIMM in a bank stores only 1/4 of the 32 bit wide data.  If you  have a 16-bit bus, two 1Mx9 SIMMs are linked together to get 16-bit wide  data, which is the reason why 286 banks are 2 SIMMs wide, and 32-bit banks  are 4 SIMMs wide.  If your computer required 1Mx36 ( e.g. 32-bit wide data  with 4 parity bits, used in some PS/2s and ASTs ), you could upgrade by  one SIMM at a time.  Hope that this message is not over your head, but the answer to your  question was not simple.  I could of just said, 'because I said so.'  -rdd      ---  . WinQwk 2.0b#0 .

Could you   please tell me if I'm right..  1- Buy a SCSI contoler.  Which one? I know Adaptec is good, but they are   kind of expensive.  Are there any good boards in the $100 region? I want   it to be compatible with OS2 and Unix if possible.  Also, I have seen on   the net that there are SCSI and SCSI2 drives. Is this true? Does the   adapter need to be the same as the drive? What type of drive is the   quantum?  2- connect the drive to the adapter via a SCSI cable and the power cable. Do i have to worry about the power supply? I think I have 200 watts and   all I'm powering are two floppies and the seagate drive.  3- Setup the BIOS to recognize the drive as the second drive.  What type   of drive is this? I don't have the numbers for this drive.  4- Format and create partitions on the drive. Do I use format or fdisk? I   think that IDE drives can't be low-level formatted. Is it the same with   SCSI? How exactly does fdisk work? I have a reduced msdos 5.0 manual   (clone obliges) and there is no mention of fdisk.  Ideally, I would want   the drive partitioned in to two partitions D: and E: how do I do this?  Well that seems to be all. Is there anythiing I'm forgetting?

Very possibly, but if it's still going to be backwards compatible with the ISA bus, it's going to be the same tripe that the current EISA implementation really is.  	From what I've seen, the PCI bus will just be a new 32bit 33MHz intelligent bus (ie, bus controller takes care of interrupts and the like, not jumpers...)

The guy told me that it had been fully tested and that it was good.  I took it home to install in my Compaq Portable (OK, I'm a little behind in technology).  I already had an MFM controller.  I installed the drive and powered up the system.  I got a post error, ""1701"".  My controller is a Western Digital WD1002S-WX2 Rev. C. As I said above, the drive is a Seagate ST-251. The system is a Compaq Portable (circa 1985).       Ah, finally a question I can answer.   I mess with this older stuff alot.   Kinda fun.  8)       First problem I can forsee is that the ST-251 will not be compadible with that WD card unless it has the right bios rom.        Check the numbers on it.  It should be the only non-smt chip on the board.  Slightly below center, and left.    The bios should read  either :     62-000042-015 or              62-000094-0x2       If the last 3 digits are 013, you got problems.   Controller jumpers are set as follows: (""-"" represents jumper) 	W1	1-2 3        W2      1-2 3 	W3	1-2 	W4	1 2-3 	W5	1 2 3 	W6	1-2 3 	W7	1 2 3      Looks right.   W5 and W7 are factory jumped (with a trace) between pins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address.  The drive jumpers are as follows: (""8"" represents jumper)      Looks right.    [art deleted]  Here are my questions:  1.)	Are the drive and controller compatible w/ each other?        I notice you left out the S1 jumper table settings.   Those are what control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you have the 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this:                5 + +    open               6 + +    open                            7 + +    open                       8 + +    open               4 + +    closed               3 + +    closed               2 + +    open               1 + +    open      Note:   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block. Top to bottom.   +'s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 3,4, and 8 select the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1,2 and 7 select the second drive (drive 1).           If you have the 62-000094 rom, it's a auto-config, and I'll have to look up how to do it... I don't have the big book right here.  2.)	Are the jumpers on the card/drive set correctly?        See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not right.   Also,  at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cables are on right and good. 8).    On the jumper on the 251, try moving it to the opposite side of the drive.    It's one or the other.         The narrow data cable goes to J2.   I've thrown it on J3 a few times and banged my head for a day.....  3.)	Is my system's BIOS in need of an upgrade?       Dunno.    IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82.   A quick way to check is to boot dos and run debug.   Enter:                 -d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt)         This will return the rom date, if it's of any use.  Keith Rice        If I oversimplified any of the above, I appologize.     It's just hard to know what caliber of person I'm talking to. 8).                       --   Bob Valentine  <--                     -- ravalent@mailbox.syr.edu <--      From chpp@unitrix.utr.ac.za Mon Apr  5 06:33:46 1993 Received: from unitrix.utr.ac.za by ponder (5.61/1.36) 	id AA16194  Mon, 5 Apr 93 06:32:59 -0500 Received: by unitrix.utr.ac.za (Smail3.1.28.1 #1) 	id m0nfpMA-0001X7C  Mon, 5 Apr 93 13:28 GMT Message-Id: <m0nfpMA-0001X7C@unitrix.utr.ac.za From: chpp@unitrix.utr.ac.za (Prof P.

NOTE 1:  AT&T 6300 - The AT&T 6300 and the AT&T 6300 PLUS            contain system BIOS chips that support the hard disk drive.             When using a Western Digital XT controller card the system will            not ""boot.""  To solve this problem, one of the ROM BIOS chips            must be disabled.  To disable the BIOS on your Western Digital             XT controller card, you must remove the jumper at position W-3            or add a jumper at position R-23 (depending on which model of XT            controller you are using).                                                   -2-                        NOTE 2:  TANDY 1000 SYSTEMS - The WD1002A-WX1, WD1004A-WX1,            WDXT-GEN2 and the WD1004-27X can be modified to operate in            Tandy 1000 series computers, models SX, TX and the original or            ""A"" version.  These computers utilize an interrupt of 2 (IRQ2)            instead of IRQ5, the IBM standard.  To modify the WD1002A-WX1 or            the WD1002-27X to operate in these systems, you must cut the            etch between pin 1 and pin 2 at jumper position W-7.  Then            solder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position (W-7).  To complete the            modification, a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch S-1            (2 rows of 8 pins).  PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY PHYSICAL MODIFICATION            TO YOUR WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DISK CONTROLLER VOIDS THE WARRANTY            ON YOUR BOARD.  To modify the WD1004A-WX1, WDXT-GEN2 or the            WD1004-27X for your Tandy 1000 system, a zero ohm resister must            be soldered to jumper position W-27.  This will change the            interrupt from IRQ5 to IRQ2.

If IDE speed come from IDA WHERE does the 8.3MB/s sighted for IDE come from?  SCSI is not complex. It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it. There are THREE key differences in SCSI  the controller chip, the port, and the software.  THAT IS IT. Let us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point.  SCSI-1: asynchronous and synchronous modes {SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY}  asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode {only 0-3MB/s vs. 0-5MB/s}  synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi-1 divices with a  rewrite of the software driver {As is the case for the Mac Quadra.}  SCSI-2 {8-bit}: THIS is the main source for the confusion. This differs from  SCSI-1 ONLY in the controler chip in most machines.  In the Mac and some PCs  this is called 'fast SCSI-1' because it uses SCSI-1 ports and software drivers  AND can produce SCSI-2 SPEEDS through SCSI-1 INSPITE of this even in the   slower asynchronous mode.  Average speed in asynchronous SCSi-1 mode   4-6MB/s with 8MB/s{See in both Quadras and higher end PCs} Synchronous  mode just allows a higher burst rate {10/MB/s}  SCSI-2 {16-bit}: TWO versions-Wide/Fast.  Wide SCSI-2 requires TWO things  over 8-bit SCSI-2:  a SCSI-2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the  machine and the external device.  Fast SCSI-2 also requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2: SCSI-2 driver  software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16-bit fast SCSI-2.  Speed of both is the same: 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst.  SCSI-2 {32-bit}:  Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI.  Over 8-bit SCSI-2 this  requires: SCSI-2 driver software, wide SCSI-2 port, and that the RECIEVING  devices ALSO have a 32-bit mode SCSI-2 chip.  As expected this is VERY  expencive.  Speed: 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s bursts    As I said SIMPLE.  Seven versions of SCSI seperated by software, the  controler chip, and the port. Standarize the SOFTWARE and it DROPS to only FIVE versions of SCSI seperate by only HARDWARE {the chip and the port}

It comes with ET4000/W32 window drivers and a normal Et4000 drivers. The ET4000/W32 drivers handles, 640x480, 800x600, 1024x786 in 256 colours. Also, in 640x480 and 800x600, it supports hicolor, 32K and 64K colours.  Here is my winmark result running on a 16MB 486DX33 EISA/VL-BUS system using Hint chipsets.  Winmark 3.11 from ZD lab.  Using ET4000/W32 drivers 640x480 256       10.63 megapixel/sec.         32k        7.34          64k        7.30 800x600 256       10.07         32k        6.38         64k        6.35 1kx786  256        8.17  Using ET4000 drivers. 640x480 16M        1.78 800x600  16colours 4.01      1kx786   16        4.22  From the result, the ET4000/W32 drivers are specialized to use the hardware feature of the Et4000/W32 chip whereas the ET4000 drivers are just normal driver for ET4000 based graphics card.  The price of this graphics card that I got is $185 from a local dealer. It may be less from mail order. It has OS/2 2.0 drivers comes with it which supports 256 colors on all resolution.

A technician examined it and  pronounced the disk drive unusable.  My investigations indicate that drive C is a type 27 (1024 cylinders, 9 sides). When CMOS set this way, COMPSURF runs happily, with 13 bad blocks.  I use PREPARE to Hotfix the one internal drive.  Install will proceed ""successfully"", but when I try to boot the server, it reports that the software is not serialised for this hardware.  Internal examination indicates that the keycard is present, and there is one disk drive (or at least one large single unit).   Attempts to configure a second drive in CMOS result in drive not ready errors.  Questions: ========= The software is Netware 286 Level II and I can see burnt on to the screen SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a. However, to configure netware for level II (mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk, yes?   So how is the Novell Server 286A normally configured?  1. Can I install SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a as Level I, or is this what is causing my serialisation error? 2. Is the Novell Server 286A normally equipped with two hard drives, one of which has failed? 3. Would this mean I can not install the network software because it will not be serialised for this hardware with a failed drive? 4. What else can cause a serialisation error? 5. What happens if the keycard fails? 6. Am I doing something wrong? Can someone knowledgeable offer some comments and guides.  Thanks for your time.

FOR SALE:  AT&T Dataport Internal 14.4K Fax/Modem  The modem is an internal AT/(E)ISA 8-bit card (just a little longer than a half-card).  It has v.32bis for 14.4Kbps data / 9600 bps fax, v.42, v.42bis, and MNP5 for error-correction and data compression, so you can get error-free links up to 57,600 bps on a conventional phone line.  They will ""fall back"" to any speed (down to 1200bps) and even disable compression and error-correction if necessary in order to connect with slower and older modems.  It has a 16550 buffered UART for better compatibility with multi-tasking operating systems (Windows, OS/2, Unix, etc).  They use a patented technology called Optical Line Interface (OLI) which reduces noise generated by the modem to assure the fastest and cleanest connection possible.  These modems come with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime tech support (and the call is free, too) from AT&T.  They also include the lovely and talented QuickLink II for DOS and the NEW QuickLink II for Windows communications and fax software which will let you conveniently sent faxes from any DOS or Windows application just by printing.  The Windows version will send faxes of any font and can include graphics, etc.  The DOS version can fax graphics and a limited set of fonts (I believe that there are 5 or so, as well as any HP Laser II resident fonts).  I'm asking $210.00 for this modem (plus Utah tax).  This is at or below the prices of any other (reputable) manufacturer of an equivalent modem (including Zoom, US Robotics, etc).  And, it is backed by a company that will never go away.  This price will include delivery if you live within 20 miles of downtown SLC.  I can also arrange shipping, or you can stop by my home to pick it up.  (If you're concerned about installing an internal modem, let me know and we can discuss an arrangement for including installation.)  If you're interested, please let me know.  This is an excellent modem at an excellent price (they normally list for ~$500 and retail for about ~$300).  I installed one of these last week and it is very nice.  If you have questions about this, AT&T has an info number at  (800) 554-4996, or you can email me and I will attemp to answer them.

It must be real nice to get shafted by $20-$100 bucks for the extra cost of a SCSI drive, then pay another $200-$300 for a SCSI controller.  Yeah, there is absolutely no use for VLB except for video graphics. And no IDE could possibly take advantage the VLB, because it runs at 8 Mhz and 16 bits. Do people forget that the IDE was specifically designed to interface directly with the AT ISA bus? We've seen IDEs come out for EISA, XT ISA, and now even MCA, but at all times it was a 16 bit standard, running at somewhere near 8-10 Mhz. When you run an IDE off of the VLB, there's no way that you're running it at 33 Mhz, it would burn up. Of course same goes for SCSI, ESDI, whatever, none of them run at CPU speed.  The only way to gain advantage with a VLB IDE is to hook it up to a caching controller. I suspect it would be much, much better to get a software disk cache instead, since you get write-caching as well.  because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that big.  I've seen some Fuji IDE drives going as high as 1G.  						Yousuf Khan

Smith writes:   but I still want to know why it intrinsically better  (than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when  managing data from a single SCSI hard drive.  A SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request data from the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data and moves it to memory.   IDE also uses DMA techniques.  I believe floppy controller also uses DMA, and most A/D boards also use DMA.  DMA is no big deal, and has nothing to do directly with SCSI.   For example, when rewinding or formatting a tape, the command is issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other devices on the bus.  This greatly increases productivity or, at least, do something else while backing up your hard drive :-).  Which happens to be what I am doing while reading this group.  You can thank your software for that.  If DOS had a few more brains, it could format floppies etc. while you were doing something else.  The hardware will support it, but DOS (at least) won't.  Again, this has    nothing to do with SCSI.  Its a long story, but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which, thanks to SCSI, I can move between both machines.  If, and when, SCSI is better standardized and supported on the ibm-clone machines, I plan to completely get rid of IDE.  And if you stick with DOS you'll wonder why you can't multitask.  Again I ask why can't a UNIX or OS/2 type OS do all the miraculous things with an IDE harddrive that it can with a (single) SCSI hard drive.

Unless you are absolutely sure you won't have any problems, you may want to trade elsewhere.  Despite the fact that they answer the phone, ""Hi! I'm <whoever and we're having a GREAT Day!"", they weren't quite so happy when I wanted to return a modem that didn't work as I expected it to.  The details:  I ordered one of their house brand ""Infotel"" 14.4/DF internal FAX modems. In reality, it was a Twincom Lightning FAX that had a paper sticker over the name. Given the poor reports on the net about this modem, I would not have ordered it, had I known this in advance.  It arrived on time. The documentation stated that it would work (and was preconfigured) as COM4, providing that COM2 was not in use at the same time.  For several reasons, I have a serial card configured for COM1/COM2. At the time I installed the modem, nothing was connected to COM2.  Although the modem appeared to work, during every connection at 9600 or 14.4, it would randomly break the connection and hang up the phone. After spending some time on the phone with MidWest's tech support, they suggested disabling the COM2 port.  This appeared to solve the disconnect problem, but was an unacceptable long term solution. I had to have COM1 and 2 available, even though they both would not be in use at the same time as the modem.  I called back 20 minutes prior to their closing and waited in Voicemail  hell, listening to repeated advertisements for MidWest Micro products. I  was then promptly disconnected. Apparently it was quiting time and they  didn't want to be bothered with callers that had been waiting on the line.  I called the next day and asked the Customer Diservice agent for an RMA number. She promptly switched me to a ""Tech Support"" rep that implied that it was my equipment at fault and that he wasn't going to give me an RMA number. He suggested I use some nonstandard IRQ settings, a solution I was not happy with. The modem should work as originally configured.  Conclusion:  I'm not sure the modem would work ok in a basic system, but it clearly does not work in a multi port system like mine. Since my time is worth more  than the aggravation or the cost of the modem, I gave it to a local charitable organization (with a description of my problem) and ordered a Practical Peripherals 14.4MT from PC Connection.  For $30 more, I have a solid external modem built by a company I know  will support their users and sold by a company (based on personal experience) will treat me right if there is a problem.

Hello, I've been following discussions on 17"" monitors in  comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware and noted that the Nanao seems to get very good reviews.  I'm interested in getting more information about Nanao's products as well as some others that may fit the bill.     I would like a monitor that can handle high resolutions like 1024x1024 NI. I'm envisioning using this monitor on an Amiga 4000 or Amiga 2000 w/a graphics board like the Retina, and/or on a Sun like the SPARCstation LX.  Basically I want a high resolution versital monitor.  This monitor need not be large (=17"") if it meets the brief requirements as outlined above.  I've been very happy with a 16"" on Suns and could probably cope with smaller at home.  I'm interested if anyone has more details on high quality Sony and Hitatchi monitors since they seem to be used on Sun's fairly often and look pretty good (to me at least).  I haven't seem them brought up in c.s.i.p.h very often as are Mag and Viewsonic.  Ok, stuff I'd like to find out:  How can I get ahold of Nanao?  What are the products in their line?  What are the technical specs?  Esp. what scan freq and max resolutions can they handle?  What's list and street cost - if avail. from a third party, and where can I get ahold of them?

If so please let me know exactly how you did and what  graphics card you used.   I wish I could help!  I posted a similar question about two weeks ago   I got no response at all.  I've asked locally at my friendly Atari store.  I was told that it should be possible, but that they had no idea how  it might be done.  Nor did they particularly care to investigate.  OK, here's my results so far....  1: You have to define the monitor as LCD - it doesn't really support    Analogue video input (It works, but isn't very linear...)  2: The incoming sync pulses need inverting. This is best achieved    with either a cmos XOR package or a transistor inverter.    If you don't know how to do it, don't even contemplate it.. :-)  3: It'll only work in standard VGA mode.  OK, having said that, I'm trying to either find a circuit or IC which will act as a universal sync decoder.  I want somethikng which basically only detects the leading sync pulse edge, and doesn't care about the polarity, outputting the -ve going pulses that the atari monitor requires.  There are 2 reasons for doing this  1: VGA cards change their sync polarity depending which mode they're    in - herc emulation is +,- while MVGA is +,+ for example.  2: It means I don't have to put a toggle switch on the back of the    monitor in order to be able to run it off both the atari and my    IBM. Currently I have 3 (Yes, 3!) monitors sitting on my desk,    and I want to get that number down as much as possible.    Being able to use the atari monitor as a paper-white VGA    will cut things down to 2. If I forget about Atari colour,    I can get down to 1.  Ultimately, the best course of action is to get a multisync monitor, but I'm as pressed for cash as anyone else, so it'll have to wait...    -- Alan Brown dogbowl@dogbox.acme.gen.nz

ESDI is always 1.25MB/s (although there are some non-standard versions) ALL this shows is that YOU don't know much about SCSI.  SCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} range is indeed 0-5MB/s and that is ALL you have right about SCSI SCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}  Note the INCREASE in SPEED, the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1  so it DOES exist. Some PC use this set up too. SCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst   By your OWN data the ""Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI"" is correct With a SCSI-2 controller chip SCSI-1 can reach 10MB/s which is indeed ""20% faster than IDE"" {120% of 8.3 is 9.96}.

Though it is WELL documented that the Quadra has a SCSI-2 chip an Apple salesperson said ""it uses a fast SCSI-1 chip"" {Not at a 6MB/s, 10MB/s burst it does not. SCSI-1 is 5MB/s maximum synchronous and Quadra uses ANsynchronous SCSI which is SLOWER}  It seems that Mac and IBM see SCSI-1 interface and think 'SCSI-1' when it maybe a SCSI-1 interface driven in the machine by a SCSi-2 controller chip in 8-bit mode {Which is MUCH FASTER then true SCSI-1 can go}.

Would you care to explain to me then, how my SoundBlaster Pro card and my printer card are sharing IRQ 7 successfully?  I assure you that they are both set to IRQ 7 and that I have no problem.  My computer is a DTK 286-12 IBM clone.  Running MS-DOS or a derivative OS, obviously. Please take note that the following is not what exactly happens, but a slightly simplified explanation.  Technically, the IRQ line is only a means for the device (printer adapter, SoundBlaster, modem, hard disk, ...) to signal the CPU that ""Something's happening here, please take note."" How the CPU is programmed to handle this signal is usually up to the operating system. In MS-DOS, the ""interrupt vector"" is used to store the address of the function that handles each interrupt.  Now, basic DOS doesn't care whether the printer reports that it's ready to print some more stuff or not - it simply ignores the interrupt.  When DOS prints, it looks at the LPT buffer.  If there's a character there, wait a while and check again.  If there's not, copy a new character to the LPT port.  Since the IRQ 7 is ignored as a printer interrupt, it's free for use for any other adapters - in this case, the SB.   With any multitasking or otherwise advanced OS, this kind of printing approach just doesn't work (or more precisely, it wastes a lot of CPU cycles.) Hence, you can't ""share"" the IRQ 7 with LPT1 and SB if you're running Unix or OS/2 or whatnot.  Another issue with the SB is that only the digitized sound uses interrupts. When the SB plays plain music, the CPU simply tells it what to play until told otherwise. With digitized sound the interrupt is required to notify the CPU when the output ends and new data is needed.  You can, however, hook two (or more) COM ports to one interrupt, but use them only one at a time.  This is because the interrupt handling routine is same for both ports, and it can see from which port the data came from. This, of course, applies for some other devices (like LPT) as well.  Remember, this was greatly simplified in parts, but I think gives the general picture correctly enough.

I've never taken a real look at the Sportster line (only Couriers), but from what I've gathered, it's basically more of an entry-level modem.  probably doesn't meet the same specifications that the Courier does.  I'm not sure if the Sportster line is fully DSP driven like the (more recent) Courier modems are, so upgrades in the future may be an issue.  again, take all of the above with a grain of salt...I've never evaluated the Sportster, so I'm going by bits and pieces that I've heard.  if you want a real answer, post the question in comp.dcom.modems and you'll find people who HAVE worked with the Sportster.  personally, though, if I were going to look at the Courier modems, I'd buy the Dual Standard...then I'd get both HST and V.32bis.  in fact, this is exactly what I did.  :-)  I'm sitting here looking at my USR DS right now.  and now, to correct a few VERY incorrect statements....  folks, if you want to get reliable answers to modem and/or UART questions, post them to comp.dcom.modems.  if you post in other groups, you never know what you'll get in the way of an answer (you may very well get a good answer...or you may get something like the one below).  at least in cdm, if someone posts complete and utter bs, you'll see a flurry of folks correcting them (to avoid spreading faulty info).  The Sportster at 14.4 has v.42 error control and v.42 bis data compression.  just as it does at lower speeds, too.  there is absolutely nothing in either CCITT Recommendation V.42 or V.42bis that says that they can only operate on modems that are running V.32bis.  V.42bis, of course, is currently only *STANDARDIZED* for operation on top of V.42 (in its primary mode of operation, LAPM), but that's about as far as that goes.  and just in case there's some confusion on this, V.42/V.42bis are also supported by the Courier line (unless you have a really ancient one).  The difference with the Courier, is that it can run at 16.8 and only in the HST mode.   take a second look at the original question:  In a previous article, cs3sd3ae@maccs.mcmaster.ca (Holly       KS) says: What is the difference between the US Robotics Courier v32bis external                                                   see the V.32bis up there?  the question was not about the Courier HST modem, or about the Courier Dual Standard...it was about the Courier V.32bis modem.  the modem in question does not support HST, period.  it therefore does not support the 16.8 kb HST.  also, not all Courier HST / Courier Dual Standard modems support the 16.8 kb version of HST.  my Dual Standard only supports HST at 14.4 kb.  there are even older models that only run HST at 9.6 kb.  This is a proprietary mode of USR and it will only connect to another of the same type unit to achieve this speed.  HST is USR's proprietary modulation scheme....  but we're not talking about HST, we're talking about V.32bis.  V.32bis is most definitely *NOT* a proprietary modulation scheme.  The Sportster will do asynchronous transmissions as well as synchronous.  The HST is one way only.  I do hope you didn't mean for these two sentences to be related in some way.....  first off, V.32 and V.32bis are both synchronous and asynchronous.  this is part of the CCITT Recommendation (i.e., part of the standard).  it isn't a feature unique to the Sportster (I just looked at the appropriate chapter in the Courier DS manual).  second, HST is not ``one way only.''  more correctly put, it is an asymmetrical modulation scheme, meaning it doesn't work at the same speed in both directions.  HST operates at [9.6 / 14.4 / 16.8] in one direction, and has a low-speed back-channel in the other direction.  the high-speed channel goes in the direction of the higher data flow.  this is fine if you're logged on to say, a BBS, and type one letter and get screens of info back, transfer files (not using bimodem), etc....  there is, of course, a penalty for turnaround time when the high-speed channel needs to reverse directions.  V.32 and V.32bis are both symmetrical, meaning they do transfer the full data rate in both directions at the same time.  third, synchronous vs asynchronous has absolutely nothing to do with symmetrical vs asymmetrical...they are two completely different topics.  The HST's will be upgradeable to the v.fast spec when it is available.  again, more correctly put, *SOME* of the Courier line will be upgradeable to whatever ``V.fast'' is called when it's complete.  if you have the large footprint Courier modems (like I do), you're S.O.L.....  there was an upgrade plan a while back to upgrade to a small footprint variety, which could eventually be upgraded to support V.fast, but the cost of the two upgrades together pretty much put it higher than just buying a new modem.  later.....    --jim  -- #include <std_disclaimer.h                                 73 DE N5IAL (/4) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ INTERNET: jim@n5ial.mythical.com  |  j.graham@ieee.org     ICBM: 30.23N 86.32W AMATEUR RADIO: n5ial@w4zbb (Ft.

My problem is this.  My system only had a IDE cable : for one drive, so I had to buy cable with two drive connectors : on it, and consequently have to switch cables.  The problem is,  : the new hard drive's manual refers to matching pin 1 on the cable : with both pin 1 on the drive itself and pin 1 on the IDE card.  But : for the life of me I cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug : in the cable to align these.    Most IDE drives that I have dealt with have had pin 2 labeled on the printed circuit board (this is sufficient to determine which side is which).  If your IDE drive does not have a label, then you can look for a polarization notch in the receptacle (the connector on the drive with the pins).  If the receptacle is center polarized, that is it has one rectangular notch about 4 mm wide positioned in the center of one side, then you can identify pin 1 as follows: look into the pins with the notch at the top, pin 1 is at the top right.  On all drives I have seen this is toward the power connector.  As for which pin is pin 1 on the controller, well you can use the same criteria but look hard for the labelling of any pin.  Once you know which end pin 1&2 are on or pins 39 & 40 (the oposite end), then you are all set.  All you need to do is keep the pin 1 end connected to the pin 1 end.  You don't even have to look at the cable itself.  Just trace the pin 1 side of the cable through.  Usually the pin 1 of the cable is identified by a different color (red usually).  But beware - many cable makers are not very careful about this - I have seen cables with pin 40 being the one marked red.  Of course with non-polarized connectors this doesn't matter - you can plug the cable in either way and YOU decide which side is pin 1.  : Secondly, the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them. : I figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into : the drives.  Does it matter which I plug into the ""master"" drive : and which into the ""Slave""?  any help appreciated.  thanks...  It doesn't matter what gets plugged where.  But it does matter how the drives are jumpered.  There will be (amongst other options) two jumpers that you should be concerned with on BOTH drives.  One jumper will select whether the drive is the slave or the master.  If it is the master, then a second jumper selects whether or not a slave is present.  You will have to consult the  docuementation that came with you drives.  If you do not have docuementation, then just call the manufacturers hotline number or fax number if they have one.  This kind of information is routinely needed by people just like yourself.  They will fax you complete info about the jumpers.  If you don't have convenient access to a fax machine, then you can usually get voice help.  Or post the specific question to this group.  (I probably won't be able to help you).

Of course, I said ""No problem"" and went to work. Unfortunately, the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive during  installation, even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive using the old DOS.  After openning it up I discovered it was using an 8-bit  Seagate SCSI controller on a ST-157N SCSI 40Mbtye drive.  I then booted  with DRDOS 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if  I could access the drive.  Lo and behold the primary 46.5 Mbyte partition  was intact (created by DOS 3.1 no less, I didn't think you could go over a 32Mbyte partition in the older DOSes. I could be wrong...).  I then tried  to remove the primary partition, which it wouldn't allow me to do.  I am  unaware of anything special that has to be done with a SCSI drive (I  kinda expected it to work just like an IDE/MFM/RLL drive for DOS  installations).

I have a Gateway 2K 486DX/33 system with the ATI Ultrapro video card (identical to the system mentioned in the original posting, except 33MHz instead of 66).  For some reason, the system refuses to recognize COM4.  For example, if I configure the on-board (motherboard) COM ports for COM1/COM2, everything is fine  if I configure them for COM3/COM4, COM3 works OK, but COM4 is not recoznized.  The diagnostics shipped with the system, the MSD utility      Windows all act as if the port isn't there.  It's not an IRQ conflict, because I can swap the IRQs for COM3 and COM4, and COM3 still works (and COM4 still doesn't).  I actually noticed this problem when trying to install 2 additional ports (a BOCA high speed 2S/1P card).  The behavior with the BOCA card was exactly the same (e.g. it would work as COM1, COM2, or COM3, but not as COM4).  This has the smell of an I/O port conflict, but I can't imagine with what.  There are no other expansion cards installed in the machine other than the video card, and Gateway would have to be pretty stupid to have the on-board COM4 conflict with something else on the motherboard!  Has anybody else had this problem?   I ran into this about six months ago.  My system is a GW2000 486DX/66V, 8 megs RAM, 1Meg ATI GUP VLB. It seems the problem is that the ATI Graphics Ultra Pro card consumes the COM4 port for some reason, so only COM1-3 are available.

comp_sys_ibm_pc_hardware;"From: sherwood@adobe.com (Geoffrey Sherwood) Subject: Orchid P9000 vs Fahrenheit (mini review)   I just purchased a Viewsonic 17 and and Orchid P9000.  In short, I am happy with the monitor and unhappy with the card.  I have spent a lot more time futzing with the card, so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitor is pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17"" Magnavox went away.  It isn't as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs, I think).  So much for the monitor.  On to the bitch session and test results.  In going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors in 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS program which uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA, Orchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those are all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses a Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them).  The Hercules Graphite card does seem to have these modes, but I didn't run the same test cases as I did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to print the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia, though, which the S3 cards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.  The supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if you tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors listed plus 'Generic', and if you choose Generic you can't get any high refreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz at 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution was the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have, and it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well.  The higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone with Orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (I don't know what I have) he was unable to recreate the problem.  On the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful as he could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn't have the problem.  He didn't know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either.  The board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules Speedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results in pixels/second.  I don't have the numbers for the Graphite card, but they were close to half of the OFVLB (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20MHz 386, ISA, so the numbers aren't really comparable.

I have no idea what is being done internally as far as conversions go.  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to the screen, my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can just be copied to the video display.  The screen to screen test copies that face from place to place on the screen.  Awesome!  Interestingly, the solid vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie, filled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.  Graphics operations like XORs maybe????) are a dead loss on the 9000.  I give two numbers for the 9000 fonts, because I think they are caching. When the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly -- 1/3 the speed of the OFVLB.  Then the speed increases dramatically.  Sounds like programming to a benchmark to me....  I make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all.  Its just what I saw when I ran them on my computer.  I normally don't write disclaimers, but this time maybe I'd better.  My testing is totally unconnected with my work (I program under UNIX on Decstations) is done completely without the knowledge, blessing, or equipment of my company.  geoff sherwood"

The other is a 386DX (213 SCSI drive w/ Adaptec 1522 controller).  Both      systems have PC TOOLS and will use Central Point Backup as the backup /      restore program.

Put 2.88MB floppy drives (or a combination drive) on each system.     Can someone supply cost and brand information?  What's a good brand?     What do the floppies themselves cost?   2.

The only brand I remember is Colorado Memories.  Any     happy or unhappy users (I know about the compression controversy)?    3.  Connect an external tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and     (maybe?) connect it to the 286 somehow (any suggestions?)   4.  Install a Floptical drive in each machine.

For AT class and later machines, IRQ5 is reserved for LPT2.  Since it's rare to have a second parallel port in a PC, it's usually a good safe choice if you need an interrupt.  On the other hand, we just ran into a problem with that here at work on a Gateway computer (4DX-33V).  It has a Modem on COM1, a Mouse on COM2, and the other serial port was set to COM3 (which normally uses the same interrupt as COM1).  We had a real fight with a board when trying to use IRQ5, and discoverd the problem was that Gateway had set it up such that COM3 used IRQ5.  As soon as we disabled COM3, our problems went away.

Completely smooth.  Not that it runs poorly normally, but on these days, it is exceptional.  My theory is that the air density and moisture content of the air are such that I get complete combustion.  Needless to say, it puts me in a great mood.  The mood lasted for about 20 miles.  Heading north on the 405 freeway, about a mile or two south of the 10, my throttle stopped responding.... and I was between lanes.  Nothing to do but make  my way over 4 lanes to the shoulder... initially by gliding, then by pushing.  At least traffic was heavy enough so that cars did not mind stopping for me.  Turned out to be a screw unscrewed inside my Mikuni HS40  carb.  I keep hearing that one should keep all of the screws tight on a bike, but I never thought that I had to do that on the screws inside of a carb.

I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the  approved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target,  then take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it  didn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to my  house, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to  the Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to  the Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to  harm.  [interesting dog collision story deleted]   What worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could have  prevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not  necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was  riding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if  it had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the  thought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a  blind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are  long enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?    I eagerly await comment.  My driveway and about half my neighbor's driveways are long enough to do a good 80 clicks (50mph for the velocity impaired) if we wanted to. Granted, I live in the country, however I've seen neighbors whip out of their driveways at the above mentioned 30 mph quite a bit- they claim they can tell that ""There's noone on the road for quite a ways."" This despite having nearly been hit myself by one of them while driving a Chev 4x4, and twice taking my 10-speed bicycle over the hood of a car that had pulled out, saw me, *then* stopped.

It is certainly possible, and quite easy in most cases, especially on two-strokes.

I dart my eyes to my mirrors and realize it's the  moroon flying up right behind me, in my panic I pop my clutch and stall the bike.  Luckily the guy stops a foot behind my rear wheel. I understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you really in actuality avoid such an incident?  Suggestions?  The experience you describe is why I don't like to sit with my bike in gear - I figure there's a chance that I'll be startled in some way and stall my bike.  And I figure this is more likely than the chance that I'll be unable to escape some situation because of the extra time needed to put the bike in gear.  So I concentrate on avoiding situations rather than making split-second evasive manuvers.  I split lanes so I'm not at the end of the line. (Unfortunately this is not legal in most of the country)  If I can't split (perhaps there isn't room) then I will stop near one side of the lane so I have an easy escape, and leave my bike in gear until the next car has stopped.  I watch in my mirrors in the mean time to make sure it will!  Whether I really would have time to move should a car fail to stop, I haven't had to find out yet.  Some cars have an annoying habbit of racing up behind you before braking heavilly, so it can be hard to tell if they are planning to brake or not!

Look over the shoulder thats most comfortable, but during turns look over the shoulder on the inside of the turn.  I've found that the phrase ""sack of potatoes"" works pretty well in describing to a passenger how s/he should act.

I really would like some advice on what would  be a good starter bike for me.  I do know one thing however, I need to  make my first bike a good one, because buying a second any time soon is  out of the question.  I am specifically interested in racing bikes, (CBR  600 F2, GSX-R 750).  I know that this may sound kind of crazy  considering that I've never had a bike before, but I am responsible, a  fast learner, and in love.    Responsible and in love?  I believe that's a contradiction in terms.  Unless you're really brave (read: ""reckless"") a 500cc sport bike will go way faster than you dare for at least your first year of riding.  Getting more than that really is overkill, as you'll never even want to use it.  The following bikes can be bought (and repaired!) cheaply, are easy for a novice to manage, and are plenty high performance:     Kawasaki EX-500     Honda VF-500 ""Interceptor""     Suzuki GS-550E  The 0-100mph time of the EX-500 at full throttle is ""way sooner than you're ready for it"".  :-)  With something as small as a 250, you'd probably be wishing for more power pretty quickly (unless it's a TZR or RGV :).  Now, I'm not saying that you're 100% certain to kill yourself immediately with a 600f2 or a GSXR-750.  Plenty of people have started riding on those bikes and done just fine.  What I am saying is that it's a waste of money, and a waste of perfectly good plastic when you drop the thing learning how to balance while stopping. You'll never get the throttle more than half open anyway, so why spend the extra 2000 bucks?  --- chris"

I have so far avoided forking out the roughly $150 for the Suzuki part by kludging in different Honda regulator/rectifier units from junkyards.  The charging system consistently overcharges the battery.  I have to refill it nearly weekly. This in itself is not so bad, but battery access is gained only after removing the seat, the tank, and the airbox.  My regulator lasted over 100,000 miles, and didn't overcharge the battery. The wiring connectors in the charging path did get toasty though, tending to melt their insulation.  I suspect they were underspecified  it didn't help that they were well removed from cool air.  Battery access on the earlier bikes doesn't require tank removal. After you learn the drill, it's pretty straightforward.  [...] replacement parts, like all Suzuki parts, are outrageously expensive.

The serious overreaction ought to be worth a couple of points, not to mention the bit condemning everthing the flamee might ever say. The non sequitur about guns and helmets is just the proper flourish.  I personally am of the opinion that there are two types of good flames. The first does trade ``quality,'' in the sense you mention, for heat. This has a certain surprise value and if done correctly, which I contend was done above, is reasonably entertaining.  While it is true that the flame I posted does not mention anyone's habitual velocity, friends, dinner, or entertainment, it says what it needs to with the appropriate flair and it is short.  The weakness of this type of flame is actually that it can easily be taken too far, at which point it becomes trite and boring.  (Witness the Infante thread recently....)  The other type of flame, which you seem to be glorifying above, has a few weaknesses as well.  In the first place, it can get verbose and  tedious in the extreme, particularly if the reader does not already strongly identify with one side or the other.  In the second, discussing someone's personal qualities, habits, and so forth can quickly become libelous. (Or is that slanderous?  I can never remember the difference.)  This leads to a proliferation of lawyers, which is widely regarded as a BAD THING. Finally, introducing polysyllabic words is problematic.  I can't haul my big dic. around on my bike, and it would be bad form to use a word which actually turned out to have a meaning, especially one which ran counter to my use and flamage in general.  In summary, Blaine, your score for that flame is incorrect.  While it may be the wunder-flame, the weaknesses you point out are not necessarily weaknesses, and your suggested corrections are not always useful nor applicable.  You also probably couldn't outrun a tennis ball with a flatulent dog stapled to your posterior, and I'll bet you and your  motorcycle lean to the outside while turning.

I had the same problem after about 7-8 years of constant use, and I was thinking of seeing how much Eclipse would want to install a new zipper.

It should work for any of the nylon-coil type zippers.  OTOH- I tried this on my HG Concord jacket Thursday night.  Really, I just made a tiny-adjustment type of squeeze.  Really.  Is (was? :-( ) your HG zipper the nylon-coil type or the kind with molded plastic teeth? I've only tried it on the coiled nylon type, and it doesn't take much squish to fix the problem. I found I was overdoing it (no broken parts, but the zipper was too hard to pull) so after spreading the zipper pull jaws again, I tried with Vice-Grips. No, not the usual Grip Of Death technique, I adjusted the closed Vice-Grips so they were snug on the zipper jaws, then released them and tightened the adjusting screw a bit. A couple of iterations and I had just the right amount of Zipper Squish (TM).  Result: I now know that noplace in Spokane will even _consider_ trying to repair a broken zipper-closer-thingy, which must be a $0.30 part which needs a $20 tool to install.  I've had two zipper pulls fail on my Aerostich suit (actually on the Accessory Ellipse), and they sent me a few replacement pulls free of charge. I don't know what brand of zippers HG uses, but parts ARE available for YKK's plastic zippers. Replacement was pretty simple, just break and remove the plastic knob at the top of the zipper that keeps the pull from coming off the top end. Slide on the new zipper pull. Then crimp on (Vice-Grips again!) a replacement zipper stop.  You might try fabric stores & such and see if they sell replacement parts.  Oh, for what it's worth, the coil-type zippers on the Eclipse tankbag are also YKK. --  Blaine Gardner @ Evans & Sutherland bgardner@dsd.es.com

It came with no instructions, but it came 2 weeks earlier than they said it would.  Installation would have been very easy, but the seat fastening hardware was apparently always on the wrong sides with the stock seat!  It never was easy to put on.  Once I figured that out, the new seat went on the first try.  The passenger backrest, though, does not fit as I thought it might.  The supplied screw to set the  backrest angle does not fit, and I have not yet found a suitable,  hard, ( SAE grade 8, or perhaps 5 ) 1/4-20 bolt that fits.  There is a a soft bolt in there now -- just don't lean back.  The driver's section of the seat is a bit wider.  Seems comfortable enough, but then again I put about 5000 miles on the stock seat without a thought.  The passenger's section has about 8 times the  volume of foam that the stock seat has, and from my short test it seems much more comfortable.  The backrest helps a bit, but I've not  has enough time to really test it.  The backrest also comes with a  small pocket.  Its now more difficult to swing my leg up over the  10"" taller seat.  If I go on the three-notch ride soon ( Dixville, Pinkham & Smugglers), I'll give a more complete report, but in general it seems like an improvement. --  	 Frank Evan Perdicaro 				Xyvision Color Systems       Legalize guns, drugs and cash...today.		101 Edgewater Drive    inhouse: frank@marvin, x5572				Wakefield MA outhouse: frank@contex.com, 617-245-4100x5572		018801285"

Are you seriously suggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster or more competentlY than you could manage otherwise??  If he's not, I will.  Put two riders on identical machines.  It's the one who knows what he's doing, and why, that will be faster.  It *may* be possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is, through trial and error, but it is not very effective methodology. Only by understanding the technique of steering a motorcycle can one improve on that technique (I hold that this applies to any human endeavor).  that's all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge, and to claim that it is essential for all bikers to know it, or that you can corner faster or better as a result, is absurd.  Do you consider an understanding of the physics of traction absurd? Are you seriously suggesting that one can form a traction management policy without understanding what it is or what factors increase or decrease available traction?  Braking?  It is highly unlikely that any biker is going to develop his maximum swerving ability without any knowledge of turning techniques.  For most of his riding life this may not be a problem, but in an emergency situation it is very definately placing him at a disadvantage.  But by including countersteering theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily, right at the time when there are *far* more important matters for them to learn.  I disagree.  The existance and immense success of riding courses which teach the technique indicate that the concept can be taught in a manner that is neither confusing, nor detracts from any other aspects of the course.  And that was my original point.  Perhaps, but in the ensuing discussion, you strayed far from that point, to claim that knowledge of steering technique is irrelevant to a rider's ability.

I don't see many people using slip-on's but they are heavily advertised and half as expensive.  Thanks! Dave   Cost is lower than OEM replacements and they weigh less. Also, in most  instances you do not have to rejet the carburetors to get a little more  performance. I replaced my OEM canister with an Ontario systems slip on. The mid-range performance is better but I also notice a slight stumble at  2-3K rpm. After talking to Kaz Yoshima, the developer and manufacturer of  the slip on, he thinks I might need larger pilot, idle, jets. Was not suppose to but maybe where I live makes a difference. Altitude, barometric pressure... Anyway, besides that minor glitch, I like the slip on performance and the sound, which is louder than stock, but not loud enough to annoy folks. The Ontario  slip on use some sort of sound baffling technique to reduce the sound at full  throttle.  Just remember, every bike is a tuned system. When you change the intake or exhaust characteristics beyond the allowable delta of the manufacturer, you may have to change other areas to compensate. Like a complete change of the exhaust system, header and muffler, changes the exhaust characteristic to the point which re-jetting is required to compensate for the new engine breathing/pumping profile.  Talk with the folks who make the slip on you intend to use and ask them if they have used it on your particular bike. Check with people who have the system also to see what they think about there slip on.  Also, as a last data point, in Sport Rider's first issue, did a review on a group of header and exhaust systems for the CBR600F2. They also included, as a  side bar, the Ontario slip on, the Dyno showed an increase from stock of 5bhp at the rear wheel, 85 verses 91.

My Kawasaki KZ 750 L4 has 2-3 millimetres of play on the gearchange pedal axle, in other words, I can move the axle sideways & up-and-down for few millimetres to each direction. This doesn't bother me when riding, but I guess fixing it wouldn't hurt. Last summer I took the bike to a shop to have the valves adjusted, and the mechanic mentioned that it should be an easy job. All I would have to do is to remove the front sprocket cover and replace a bushing or a seal that I would find there. Well, upon a closer inspection I discovered that the gearchange axle doesn't even run through the sprocket cover. It seems that, in addition to removing the cover, I would have at least to remove the sprocket and then the cover that is behind the sprocket.  Question : Would removing this small cover from the left side of the engine enable me to lay my hands on that bushing/seal (Don't know the exact term in english, sorry) ?  Question : Has anybody done this disassembly job for this or some other purpose ? Does the oil, for example, stay inside the engine ?  Thanks !  Teppo Nieminen DoD #2000 Zoo Mc Helsinki Finland

Holding the meter close to his body probably caused a high reading, and doing it inside the garage with the door closed undoubtedly enhanced the dB level! So if any other NH riders need to get this done, make sure the inspection is done outdoors with the meter held well away from the body.  Second, these Bub pipes are bloody terrific.

Didn't seem to  screw up the actual shell.   I'd bet the price of the helmet that it's okay...From 6 feet or higher, maybe not.   If I don't end up replacing it in the real near future, would I do better  to wear my (totally nondamaged) 3/4 face DOT-RATED cheapie which doesn't fit  as well or keep out the wind as well, or wearing the Shoei RF-200 which is a  LOT more comfortable, keeps the wind out better, is quieter... but might  have some minor damage?  I'd wear the full facer, but then, I'd be *way* more worried about wind blast in the face, and inability to hear police sirens, than the helmet being a little damaged.    Also, what would you all reccomend as far as good helmets? I'm slightly  disappointed by how badly the shoei has scratched & etc from not being  bloody careful about it, and how little impact it took to chip the paint  (and arguably mess it up, period)... Looking at a really good full-face with  good venting & wind protection... I like the Shoei style, kinda like the  Norton one I saw awhile back too... But suspect I'm going to have to get a  much more expensive helmet if I want to not replace it every time I'm not  being careful where I set it down.  Well, my next helmet will be, subject to it fitting well, an AGV sukhoi. That's just because I like the looks. My current one is a Shoei task5, and it's getting a little old, and I crashed in it once a couple of years ago (no hard impact to head...My hip took care of that.).

If it's a choice between injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is only one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put the dog first.  Second, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react to a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're playing with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which has hostile intent.  Third, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social beasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are two types of fellow-creatures  that which he dominates, and that which dominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the latter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible. But God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may even on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh rapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!  Now, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to assume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a game, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one  when you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of interception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so that when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to react to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a motorcycle is capable of.  With a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures may be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important -- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the road, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up newspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will hurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is that you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The larger the dog, the greater your anger.  Dogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he are not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he is on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.  Most dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory where there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are satisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped punishment.  The interesting thing about dogs is that body language communicates a great deal to them.  The more effective you are at communicating body language, the less you actually have to do.  After 7 years with my 93 pound beast, I've learned a few tricks I think...

rec_motorcycles;"From: keller@hubble.ifa.hawaii.edu (Tim Keller) Subject: airhorns on an FJ1100 review              For those of you who are thinking about fiamms, you might also want to think about airhorns. I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from  Dennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my '85 FJ1100. They are rated at 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to the relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relay pins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used a crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA. 	I installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front fairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube frame used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to do this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two vertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing follows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing. The compressor is about 2"" in diameter and about 5"" long. 	The relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small so there should be plenty of good places for it. 	I found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to mount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side just in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of the horns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where the gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough room to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice cut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into. 	The short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out about an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look closely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight ahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you). 	If you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can try to explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them first. 	How do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They sound more like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock. I have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has not blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short). 	I've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though they know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keeping the pedestrians on the sidewalk. The bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to those stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives) and are relatively easy to install on the FJ. YMMV.  -TJK '85 FJ1100 with ""GET OUT OF MY WAY"" horns. ""That looks like a suit you'd fight a fire in"" -comment about the Aerostich"

Tough question -- more dangerous than driving a car, and far more dangerous if you don't apply a modicum of intelligence to the  activity.  Basically, stupidity will get you hurt/killed a lot faster on a motorcycle than in a car.  But with care, it is not unreasonably dangerous.  Also, buying good protective clothing is helpful, that way if something does go wrong, you are likely to be less severely injured.  First thing, if possible take a (MSF) driver training course, this will get you started on the right foot -- they teach control of the vehicle and safe riding practices.  Second, buy protective gear.  At minimum a good helmet and a pair of leather gloves are a must.  A good sturdy  piece of footgear is also very helpful, though leather hiking boots, a pair of old army boots, or something similar works fine for this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay  tied.  After those, a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps are nice as well  but these are also expensive items.  For the pants, many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable, preferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight.  Similarly for a jacket, a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise, though more people tend to have leather jackets around than pants.  Another thing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a second-hand leather jacket.  Look for a fairly thick leather in these items.  Third don't do anything stupid -- don't ride after  drinking, even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement and balance  don't ride in the snow, or when conditions are such that black ice is likely  be very careful riding in the rain -- slow way down, take corners gingerly,  brake early and gently   try not to ride if you are sick, tired, taking any medication with drowsiness warnings, or otherwise not in average shape.  With care, you should be ok.  The next question I have is what bike would you recommend for a first time rider. I don't want to race  nor do I want to ride cross country  nor do I want to ride on dirt trails. I'll probably drive it on back roads with occasional rides on city streets and freeways. The maximum I can spend is about $2500 so I'll be looking at a used bike.  I would suggest mid to late 80's japanese mid-sized standard. Something in 400-650 cc range would probably be reasonable.  If you are shorter/lighter than average, you might want to go as low as a 300-400 cc bike.  Possible models:  The Suzuki GS### series (eg. GS500, GS650, etc.).  These are generally inline 4 bikes, generally dependable except for a tendency to  weakness in the charging system.  (Stator and/or Regulator/Rectifier  problems.)  My first bike was a (about '82) GS650, it server me well.  The Honda Nighthawk series (this may also be known as the CB### series I think).  eg. Honda CB450, CB650, etc.  This is another series of standard motorcycles.  Also fairly dependable.  Kawasaki and Yamaha probably have similar bikes, but I don't know them as well.  For mid to late '80s models of the above, you should be able to buy the bike for under $2000, leaving you money for protective  clothing and insurance and licensing costs.  Hope this helps, -David (dagibbs@qnx.com)"

I don't know if it's adjustable, but my source says it's more difficult to pick than most locks, and the cable tends to squish flat in bolt-cutter jaws rather than shear (5/8"" model).  	FYI, I'll be getting a Krypto cable next paycheck.  A word of warning, though:  Kryptonite also sells almost useless cable locks under the Kryptonite name.  When I obtained my second motorcycle, I migrated one of my Kryptonite  U-locks from my bicycle to the new bike.  I then went out shopping for a new lock for the bicycle.  For about the same money ($20) I had the choice of a Kryptonite cable lock (advantages: lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both, Kryptonite name) or a cheesy no-name U-lock (advantages: real steel). I chose the Kryptonite cable.  After less than a week, I took it back in disgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name U-lock.  First, the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite, is not covered by the Kryptonite guarantee, and doesn't even approach Kryptonite standards of quality and quality assurance.  It is just some generic made-in-Taiwan cable lock with the Kryptonite name on it.  Secondly, the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke.  I don't know if mine was a particularly poor example, but it was often quite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage, and sometimes it would seem to engage, only to fall open when I went to unlock it.  Thirdly, the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves the sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the  dark.  I didn't try it (obviously), but I have my doubts that the  lock mechanism would stand up to an ""insert screwdriver and TORQUE"" attack.  Fourthly, the cable was not, in my opinion, of sufficient thickness to  deter theft (for my piece of crap bicycle, that is).  All cables suffer the weakness that they can be cut a few strands at a time.  If you are patient you can cut cables with fingernail clippers.  Aviation snips would go  through the cable in well under a minute.    --    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------   Michael Robinson                          UUCP:   ucbvax!cogsci!robinson                                         INTERNET: robinson@cogsci.berkeley.edu"

I was riding downhill at ~60mph on a local backroad when a brown dobie came  flashing through the brush at well over 30mph, on an intercept course with  my front wheel. The dog had started out at the top of the hill when it heard  me and still had a lead when it hit the road. The dog was approaching from  my left, and was running full tilt to get to my bike on the other side of  the road before I went by. Rover was looking back at me to calculate the  final trajectory. Too bad it didn't notice the car approaching at 50+mph  from the other direction.  I got a closeup view of the our poor canine friend's noggin careening off  the front bumper, smacking the asphalt, and getting runover by the front  tire.

If anything, the clearances seem to be getting a little smaller which makes no sense to me with the pad system - the pads should wear until the clearances are too great right?  I know that threaded adjusters can tighten  up, but I didn't think these kind could.  Bottom lines is that I haven't touched my valves for 30K on this bike and they are still nice and quiet and if anything, the clearances are tighter... What's the deal?  Any other Yam triple owners notice extremely long valve adjustment intervals?  Yeah, I had an XS750 that was the same. The valve seats tend to wear  very slowly, and anything that might get taken off the pad (which shouldn't really wear) will tend to compensate - so it's a sort of self-compensating system.

If they fit the shoulders and arms, they're too tight across the chest, or something like that. Anyone have any  suggestions?

More importantly, does anyone in Boulder or Denver know of a shop that bothers carrying any?  I was very lucky I found a jacket I liked that actually _fits_. HG makes the v-pilot jackets, mine is a very similar style made by Just Leather in San Jose. I bought one of the last two they ever made.  Finding decent womens motorcycling gear is not easy.  There is a lot of stuff out there that's fringed everywhere, made of fashion leather, made to fit men, etc.  I don't know of a shop in your area.

Vibration? BMW's don't vibrate. Everyone knows that.  I'd agree with Henry.  The grips are really nice to have in winter, and aren't noticably different from 'normal' grips in summer.    My only complaint is that the 'low' setting might as well be 'off'. This has been complained about by every reviewer, official and unofficial, that's ever talked about these grips.  The 'high' setting is often too high for use with lightweight summer gloves when things just get a bit nippy, but since 'low' doesn't produce a noticable effect, I end up turning the grips on and off to keep the temperature about right.  This generally isn't a problem when wearing thicker winter gloves.  When I asked the dealer if they could fix it, I received a consoling pat on the back, and their sincere apologies for the poor design (actually, I was told they worked just like they were suppose to).

There's a space between each link where the ""teeth"" of the  locking head notch in.  Thus, each link is a possible locking point.  Also, (and this is not applicable to hard-core thieves who cart around liquid nitrogen and oxy-acetylene torches) the cobralinks ""LOOK"" a lot more effective than kryptonite cable locks (IMHO) and I think the initial appearance effect is more relevant to bored-joyriders-nominally-adept-at- cracking-unsecured-bike deterrence, as long as the lock is nominally  functional.

No cracks in the heads or pistons, the cylinder walls look  very clean, and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable. All  still within factory specs.

One guy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell.  Well, I saw one think that someone said about ""Show me a team that used Split- fires....""  Well, here's some additional insight and some theories about splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages.  Splitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and increased power for the 4x4 cages.  Well, for these guys, splitfires  Now I don't know about all of this (and I'm trying to catch up with somebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than  Splitfires work mainly by providing a more-or-less unshrouded spark to the combustion chamber. If an engine's cylinder head design can benefit from this, then the splitfires will yield a slight performance increase, most noticeably in lower rpm range torque. Splitfires didn't do diddly-squat for my 1992 GMC pickup (4.3l V6) but do give a noticeable performance boost in my 1991 Harley Sportster 1200 and my best friend's 1986 Sportster 883. Folks I know who've tried them in 1340 Evo motors can't tell any performance boost over plain plugs (which is interesting since the XLH and big twin EVO combustion chambers are pretty much the same shape, just different sizes). Two of my friends who have shovelhead Harleys swear by the splitfires but if I had a shovelhead, I'd dual-plug it instead since they respond well enough to dual plugs to make the machine work and extra ignition system worth the expense (plus they look really cool with a spark plug on each side of each head) --  ============================================================================= Neal Howard   '91 XLH-1200      DoD #686      CompuTrac, Inc (Richardson, TX) 	      doh #0000001200   |355o33|      neal@cmptrc.lonestar.org 	      Std disclaimer: My opinions are mine, not CompuTrac's.

This is   a very good dirt bike and has been maintained perfectly.  I never had   any problems with it.    It's a four stroke, 4 valves, liquid cooled engine. It is heavier than    a 250 2 stroke but still lighter than a Honda XR600 and has a lot better    suspension (Ohlins shock, Husky fork) than the XR. For the casual or non   competitive rider, the engine is much better than any two stroke.   You can easily lug up hills and blast through trails with minimum gear   changes.      The 1992 ignition and the carefully tuned carburation makes this bike   very easy to start (starts of first kick when cold or hot).  There is a   custom made carbon/kevlar (light 1 pound) wrap around skid plate to protect   the engine cases and the water pump.  The steering angle has been reduced    by 2 degree to increase steering quickness. This with the suspension tune-up   by Phil Douglas of Aftershock (Multiple time ISDE rider) gives it a better   ride than most bike: plush suspension, responsive steering with no head shake.    So if it is such a good bike why sell it???? Gee, I want to buy a Husaberg,   which just a husky but 25 pounds lighter... and a tad more $$$.

When I have a real BDI cager tailgating me, I've found that an effective strategy is to flash my brake light by pumping the pedal. You will, obviously need a bit of free play in your brake pedal to do this. It seems that even the most brain dead idiot can usually discern that a flashing red light directly in front of him/her/it may mean that something is wrong.  The two problems I'd see with your strategy is that the red light may change before you can get anything meaningful out of your mouth, or the occupant(s) may take exception to your opinions and demonstrate such physically (on you or your now-parked bike). Admittedly, the latter is a slim chance, but it would be enough to give me pause.    * SLMR 2.1a * sometimes you get to be the windshield, sometimes the bug                  ---- +===============================================================+ |COMPUTER DYNAMICS BBS    604-255-9937(HST)    604-986-9937(V32)| |Vancouver, BC, Canada -  Easy Access, Low Rates, Friendly Sysop| +===============================================================+

Me was thinking of going for some overnite camping trips in the local state forests. For that I was planning to get a backpack/rucksack.  The next question is how shall I carry the thing on the bike, given the metal frame and all. I have a big backrest (approx 12"" high) and was hoping that I would be able to bungee cord the backpack to the backrest.  Any one have any experiences on such experimentation?  Taking the idea further, what would happen if the backpack was fully loaded with a full load (40lbs). Is the load distribution going to  be very severly affected? How will the bike perform with such a load  clinging to the back rest. If I really secure it, with no shifting,  do I still increase my chances of surfing?  I ride my bike regularly to classes with my book bag.  I take the shoulder straps on the bag, and hook them around the rear turn signals.  I works fine.  You probably will want to attach it with a bungee cord to keep it from shifting to one side or another.   |-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-| | Dan Ramage			|ramage@charlie.ece.scarolina.edu     | |'86 Vulcan 750			|DoD#0798			      | |""I wanted a Harley, but I haven't won the lottery yet.""	      | |-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-| |""Them bats is smart, they use radar."" -D.
