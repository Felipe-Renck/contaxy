Contaxy is an extensible collaborative platform for teams to share files and deploy services and jobs easily using Docker or Kubernetes.The platform is secured so only members of a project can access its resources (files, services, jobs). Its strong extension system allows to add further functionality to the backend and web app and also to override the behavior of Contaxy's core endpoints. By adding project members or generating fine-granular access tokens, resources can easily be shared with others. Deploying a service and securely sharing it with a stakeholder? No problem. It is based on the [Machine Learning Lab project](https://github.com/SAP/machine-learning-lab) with a completely rewritten backend and web app using the newer React functions.

## Highlights

- üîê Secure multi-user development plaform for collaboration.
- üóÉÔ∏è Upload, manage, version, and share files.
- üéõ Deploy and share services.
- üê≥ Deployable on a single-server via Docker or a server-cluster via Kubernetes.

## Getting Started

### Installation

For the Docker deployment, have a look at the [docker-compose.yaml file](./test_deployment/docker-compose.yml); you can start it via `docker compose up`.

For Kubernetes, have a look at the [deploy script](./test_deployment/kubernetes/deploy.sh)/

*Note: Currently, not all Docker images are pushed to DockerHub. So, the project has to be built locally: `python build.py --make` or `act -b -j build -s BUILD_ARGS="--make" `*

### Usage

After deploying, visit `http://localhost:30010/app/`. If you deployed it via the `docker-compose.yaml` file, you can login with the credentials `Foo:Foobar`. If you deployed the Kubernetes version, you have to call the endpoint `/api/seed/default` in the browser once first.

## Development

### Start the backend locally

In the `backend` directory, run `uvicorn --app-dir=src contaxy.main:app --reload`. Set the environment variables `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_URI`, `S3_ENDPOINT`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY`, `S3_SECRET_KEY` so that the locally-started Python instance can access them.

### Testing

The project contains unit tests, integration tests, and stress tests. For the unit and integration tests `pytest` is used, for the stress tests `locust`.

To run the unit/integration tests, you have the following options:

1. in the root folder, execute `act -j build -s BUILD_ARGS="--test"`
2. in the root folder, execute `python build.py --test`
3. `cd` into the `backend/` folder and run `PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) pytest`

By default, unit tests are executed (marked via `pytest.mark.unit`). If you want to execute the integration tests, pass `--test-marker integration` to *options 1* or *2* or `-m "integration"` to *option 3*. This can be a valid pytest markexpression, hence it would also be possible to execute unit *and* integration tests by passing `"unit and integration"` to one of the flags. If neither unit nor integration tests should be executed, pass an unknown marker such as `notests`.
By default, the deployment tests are executed for the DockerDeploymentManager. If you want to execute them for the `KubernetesDeploymentManager`, set the environment variables `KUBERNETES_INTEGRATION_TESTS=True` and `DEPLOYMENT_MANAGER=kubernetes` (for example in an `.env` file in the [backend directory](./backend)).
Using option 1 (`act`) will create a Kubernetes cluster. If you don't use `act`, make sure that a Kubernetes cluster is accessible.

> ‚ùó To point to a running instance for Contaxy and execute the RemoteEndpoint tests, set the `REMOTE_BACKEND_TESTS=True` and `REMOTE_BACKEND_ENDPOINT=$endpoint` variables. For executing LocalEndpoint tests, make sure that the Postgres database and S3 storage are reachable from the locally spawned instance via the environment variables `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_URI`, `S3_ENDPOINT`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY`, `S3_SECRET_KEY`.

To run the stress tests, you have the following options:

1. `cd` into the `backend/` folder and execute, for example, `locust -f tests/endpoint_tests/locustfile.py --host=http://localhost:8000 --headless -t1m --csv=./tests/results/locust`

> ‚ùó For the stress tests, the `--host` flag **must** be set and pointing to a running Contaxy instance.
